Her father had killed her mother in yet another case of domestic violence, and he had abandoned the child. Triggered by the past injustices she had seen, Sandhya decided that she would foster the girl.</p> <p>This defining moment marked the beginning of a life’s work. After taking the baby in, Sandhya, her young nieces, and her friends (Sunita, Durga, and Vimala) decided to establish a home for a few abandoned girls. At this time, they only had a few simple goals: to give these girls home, support their education, and teach them that they are valuable. Soon, community members from all walks of life stepped up to support their cause. From these humble roots, Sandhya’s social movement was born.</p> <p>Since the inception of her foundation, “Aarti Home for Girls” Sandhya's organization has saved over 1,000 girls from the streets of India. It became clear that this process of abandonment and gender-based discrimination could not be stopped by simply fostering the abandoned children. There needed to be a larger social movement to support mothers in protecting their children and empower women to live emotionally and economically independent lives.\"</p> <p>Please do send in your queries here:-<a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/Y5XQ3LG\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/Y5XQ3LG</a><br/>if you want us to share any questions/ queries/ thoughts with her before we meet her on 5th March 2019.</p> <p>Join us in this incredible celebration at -</p> <p>Register via the link: <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/MRCSWD2\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/MRCSWD2</a><br/>(RSVP doesn't guarantee an invite)<br/>Date: March 5th, 2019.<br/>Time: 3:00 PM</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1551589186000,"duration":16200000,"id":"259436993","name":"TensorFlow Dev Summit 2019- Extended","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1552705200000,"local_date":"2019-03-16","local_time":"08:30","updated":1552725048000,"utc_offset":19800000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":432,"venue":{"id":26216755,"name":"Altimetrik India Private Limited","lat":12.851278305053711,"lon":77.66358184814453,"repinned":false,"city":"Bengaluru","country":"in","localized_country_name":"India"},"group":{"created":1405412153000,"name":"GDG Bangalore","id":15726622,"join_mode":"open","lat":12.970000267028809,"lon":77.55999755859375,"urlname":"GDGBangalore","who":"Google Developers","localized_location":"Bangalore, India","state":"","country":"in","region":"en_US","timezone":"Asia/Calcutta"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDGBangalore/events/259436993/","description":"<p>Register at- <a href=\"http://bit.ly/TensoFlowSummitExtended\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/TensoFlowSummitExtended</a></p> <p>A half a day workshop filled with all the TensorFlow Goodness,</p> <p>Title(1) : Practical Reinforcement Learning using TFRL(Tensorflow RL) and OpenAI Gym<br/>1.
