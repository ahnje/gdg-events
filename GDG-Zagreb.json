This year, they are taking it to the next level: trying to predict the action that you are going to make at a specific time, depending on the context you're currently in and by analyzing your usage patterns based on machine learning algorithms that run locally on your phone. Those actions can be, for example, continue listening to Spotify if you plug in your headphones or call your best friend on friday nights. In this talk, I'll show how developers can take advantage of this concept by declaring the actions that your app does so Google can index it and suggest it to your users at the right time. I'll end by explaining that a building block of App Actions - Built-in Intents, can be then used to create a Conversational Action for the Google Assistant.</p> <p>Elaine has been working with mobile apps for 5 years and has been passionate about Android development since then. The main reason is because a mobile phone is basically the computer that you always have with you and is always ready to help. This is why she has been paying so much attention to the Google Assistant since it was launched. Not only it is also always ready to help users accomplish their tasks, but it also enables them to do it in a natural way, using natural language. Her passion about the Google Assistant (and a lot of talks and workshops about it!) has granted her the title of GDE for the technology.</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1541669915000,"duration":18000000,"id":"256233753","name":"DevFest Croatia 2018","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1543651200000,"local_date":"2018-12-01","local_time":"09:00","updated":1544795280000,"utc_offset":3600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":22,"venue":{"id":24743632,"name":"HUB385","lat":45.807464599609375,"lon":15.957133293151855,"repinned":true,"address_1":"Petračićeva ul. 4, , Zagreb, 10000","city":"Zagreb","country":"hr","localized_country_name":"Croatia"},"group":{"created":1462959085000,"name":"GDG Zagreb","id":19939919,"join_mode":"open","lat":45.79999923706055,"lon":15.970000267028809,"urlname":"GDG-Zagreb","who":"Members","localized_location":"Zagreb, Croatia","state":"","country":"hr","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Zagreb"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Zagreb/events/256233753/","manual_attendance_count":50,"description":"<p>GDG Zagreb and WTM Croatia are excited to announce that we are organizing the very first GDG DevFest in Croatia this year.</p> <p>What is a DevFest?<br/>GDG DevFests are large, community-run developer events happening around the globe, focused on community building and learning about Google technologies.<br/>They cover multiple product areas such as Android, Firebase, Google Cloud Platform, Google Assistant, Flutter, machine learning with TensorFlow, and Mobile Web.</p> <p>Each DevFest is inspired by and uniquely tailored to the needs of the developer community that hosts it.
