Be it at the scale of Boston Robotics or simple image recognition on our smartphones, we have heard of them time and again. Today, this work is being pushed forward by 'Tensorflow': end-to-end open source platform for machine learning (<a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.tensorflow.org/</a>), the work which came out of 'Google Brain'. It is widely used in research labs by developers and those Ph.D. scholars across the world.</p> <p>How much this sounds fascinating, wouldn't it be great if you get to do a 'hands-on' workshop on the TensorFlow, led by instructors who are creating the materials on the same?</p> <p>Google Developers Burnaby in collaboration with IEEE SFU, brings to you a 3-hour 'hands-on' workshop on TensorFlow and Deep Learning. All beginners are welcome, even if you have never worked with TensorFlow at all.

Please RSVP only on one page**</p> <p>Abstract of the talk:</p> <p>It seems like AI is everywhere these days, yet few people trust this technology, due in large part to black box algorithms, which prevent people—including the systems’ creators—from knowing and understanding why such algorithms make recommendations and decisions. Left unchecked, this lack of transparency can lead to biased outcomes that put people and businesses at risk.</p> <p>Luckily, there’s an answer to this problem: explainable AI—machine learning that can be understood by and explained to those outside engineering.</p> <p>In this talk, you’ll learn how explainable AI’s more transparent nature decreases bias and increases trust in AI and leads teams toward interpretability by helping them predict how algorithms will behave. Whether you're trying to incorporate AI into your business or want to understand how algorithms make decisions, this course will help you quickly learn the core tenets of explainable AI, the cases for and against it, and how to use it in your own business.</p> <p>About the speaker:</p> <p>Dr. Lauren Maffeo leads business intelligence research at GetApp, which matches software shoppers with the right tools and technologies to grow their businesses. As an analyst, Lauren’s areas of interest include speech and natural language tools, data mining techniques, predictive analytics, and building a business case for data science. Lauren has presented her research on bias in AI at Princeton and Columbia Universities, Twitter’s San Francisco headquarters, and Google DevFest DC, among others.
