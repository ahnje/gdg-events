In this session we will go through the basic concepts, highlighting their functions and we will \"play\" a little bit with the Lenovo Phab Tango device. </p> <p>2. Mário Antunes: Smart Cloud of Things (SCoT) an IoT/M2M platform</p> <p>IT Aveiro has been heavily invested in IoT and M2M technology. Not only in the communication layer but also in the analytic potential of these technologies (from collecting data, processing information and visualization). Although many environments are powered by smart solutions, end users do not have a simple way to gather their collective knowledge and program’s device’s behaviour. SCoT (Smart Cloud of Things) is the answer developed by IT Aveiro. The architecture builds upon ETSI standards, combined with a rich service execution environment, providing a facilitated orchestration of services and devices, as well as integrated portals for end users access. It was successfully deployed in 3 scenarios: greenhouse monitoring, smart farming, and porthole detection.</p> <p>More speakers soon!</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1501839524000,"id":"242276846","name":"GDD Europe 2017 Extended - Coimbra","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1504598400000,"local_date":"2017-09-05","local_time":"09:00","updated":1505938228000,"utc_offset":3600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":13,"group":{"created":1492644713000,"name":"GDG Coimbra","id":23346689,"join_mode":"open","lat":40.220001220703125,"lon":-8.430000305175781,"urlname":"GDG-Coimbra","who":"Members","localized_location":"Coimbra, Portugal","state":"","country":"pt","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Lisbon"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Coimbra/events/242276846/","manual_attendance_count":46,"description":"<p>Just like Google IO, GDD is an event where Google will showcase the latest developer products and platforms but this time, in Europe!</p> <p>Stay tuned for more information, as we will update this event with the plan during the upcoming weeks!</p> <p><img src=\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/d/5/b/600_464183899.jpeg\" /></p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1504887043000,"duration":14400000,"id":"243205821","name":"GDG Kids","rsvp_limit":30,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1507384800000,"local_date":"2017-10-07","local_time":"15:00","rsvp_open_offset":"PT620H","rsvp_close_offset":"PT17H","updated":1507571483000,"utc_offset":3600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":26,"group":{"created":1492644713000,"name":"GDG Coimbra","id":23346689,"join_mode":"open","lat":40.220001220703125,"lon":-8.430000305175781,"urlname":"GDG-Coimbra","who":"Members","localized_location":"Coimbra, Portugal","state":"","country":"pt","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Lisbon"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Coimbra/events/243205821/","manual_attendance_count":38,"description":"<p>O GDG Coimbra tem o prazer de apresentar o GDG Kids, um evento a pensar nos mais pequenos, que pretende mostrar que nunca é cedo demais para aprender como funciona o mundo da tecnologia.

É importante que tenham contacto com a tecnologia e que ganhem consciência de como a devem utilizar. Mentes mais jovens apreendem muito mais facilmente matérias técnicas e o GDG Kids pretende mostrar que a informática não é nenhum vilão de banda desenhada e que na realidade está mais acessível do que se possa pensar.

Dizem que é o maior hackaton de jogos no mundo, dizem que daqui saíram alguns dos jogos independentes mais jogados nos últimos anos e dizem de certeza mais coisas umas mais exageradas e outras menos. Nós dizemos que as portas da Casa das Artes estão abertas para a Global Game Jam desde 2014 e que a cada nova Jam queremos que seja melhor que a anterior.</p> <p>Para quem é isto?<br/>Para quem quer fazer jogos. Não apenas developers e muito menos só para game developers. São bem vindas e preciosas as participações de designers, ilustradores, músicos e contadores de histórias. Um jogo faz-se a muitas mãos e com tão pouco tempo para fazer um jogo vencedor quantas mais mãos para pôr à obra melhor.</p> <p>Como é que funciona?<br/>Em todo o mundo estarão equipas a postos na sexta-feira<br/>à noite quando sair o tema para a edição deste ano. Depois são 48 horas para submeter um jogo inédito. A Casa das Artes vai estar aberta ininterruptamente durante este fim-de-semana e com tudo o que as equipas podem precisar para apenas se concentrarem no desenvolvimento dos jogos, incluindo um sítio para descansarem se precisarem mesmo.

He graduated as Software Engineer from ISEC - Coimbra Institute of Engineering and have soon become particularly interested in mobile development, along its architectures and technologies. Hence, he soon started working with Android &amp; iOS native SDK, being currently entirely devoted to Flutter Google’s framework.<br/>Nevertheless, his tech skills go beyond mobile development, being likewise proficient in languages such as Java, Dart, C# and Obj-C, but also in system level ones, namely C and C++, in which he has been training students, as invited teacher, at ISEC’s and iTGROW’s partnership course for embedded systems — Apostar em TI. Lately, Miguel has also started to be recognised due to his public talks about Flutter.</p> <p>In his free time, you can find him working out at the gym, travelling the world, delighting himself with his close ones in a sushi restaurant, running up some personal and community Flutter projects or just having a good reading.</p> <p>📍 Host<br/>Nest will be our host for this Meetup.</p> <p>📱 Social Networks<br/>Twitter GDG Coimbra: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GDGCoimbra\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/GDGCoimbra</a><br/>Twitter Flutter Portugal: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FlutterPortugal\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/FlutterPortugal</a></p> ","how_to_find_us":"Centro Comercial Avenida","visibility":"public"},{"created":1555099843000,"duration":7200000,"id":"260577099","name":" I/O Extended Coimbra","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1557248400000,"local_date":"2019-05-07","local_time":"18:00","updated":1557262206000,"utc_offset":3600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":9,"venue":{"id":25190894,"name":"WIT Software","lat":40.1942138671875,"lon":-8.51063060760498,"repinned":true,"address_1":"Centro de Empresas de Taveiro, Estrada de Condeixa, 3045-508","city":"Taveiro","country":"pt","localized_country_name":"Portugal"},"group":{"created":1492644713000,"name":"GDG Coimbra","id":23346689,"join_mode":"open","lat":40.220001220703125,"lon":-8.430000305175781,"urlname":"GDG-Coimbra","who":"Members","localized_location":"Coimbra, Portugal","state":"","country":"pt","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Lisbon"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Coimbra/events/260577099/","description":"<p>Nota: para se inscreverem no evento, para além do RSPV é preciso preencherem o seguinte formulário:<br/>👉 <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Tc-i76NZNHYh_iQSmbxAs_NYl8JG495QZE4Ax-OB0A8/edit\" class=\"linkified\">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Tc-i76NZNHYh_iQSmbxAs_NYl8JG495QZE4Ax-OB0A8/edit</a></p> <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>Já com 12 edições realizadas, o Google I/O é o evento organizado pela Google para divulgar os últimos desenvolvimentos no mundo tecnológico.
