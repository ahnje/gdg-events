In this talk, we'll discuss common threat models, as well as how you can use the tools provided in Firebase and Google Cloud to secure your applications. After explaining what Firebase and Google Cloud are and why you might use them, we'll dive deep on best practices for using identity based authentication as well as how to configure Firebase Rules and Cloud IAM for least privilege access. We'll also talk about all the work GCP automatically does for you to keep your app secure.</p> <p>Bio: Mike helps developers build better mobile and web apps as a product manager on the Firebase team. Mike has been working on Firebase for four years, and has previously worked developing iOS apps at the Omni Group and building microprocessors at Texas Instruments. In his free time, he enjoys spending time in the outdoors, cooking, and hacking on embedded hardware.</p> <p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>Are you working on something interesting that you want to share?

With pre-trained models, machine learning APIs can analyze or transform our data. Moreover, AutoML techniques can customize these models, solve more specific problems, and provide insights tailored to our own needs. In this session, we'll explore what any developer can do and you’ll be an active player of a live demo. Don't put your smartphone in airplane mode!</p> <p>Bio: Laurent is a developer passionate about software, hardware, science and anything shaping the future. He works for Google where he ecstatically explores cloud technologies. In a previous life, he pioneered the ebook industry, co-created the 1st European ebook reader, and co-founded Bookeen. He now enjoys sharing his passion in international conferences.

I bet REST. Right? There is another alternative which listens to GraphQL. In this talk we are going to explain what are the differences between the aforementioned, how we can use the Apollo state management in our Angular application, and finally how we can create a very simple Trello app.</p> <p>Bio: Fanis is a Team Leader/Senior Software Engineer and works on a high tech company. He holds a BSc in Computer Science from Hellenic Open University. He has developed during the last 13 years a vast experience both in Front and Back-end with main aspects being the architectural design, the code quality, and the performance. He has worked in several big companies with technologies like C#, Java, .net MVC, Spring, in various departments such as Front-End/Back-End, Migration/Integration and many more. His passion is to build web apps with modern technologies like Angular and Node.js.</p> <p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Are you working on something exciting that you want to share?
