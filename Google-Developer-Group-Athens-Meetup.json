In this talk, we'll discuss common threat models, as well as how you can use the tools provided in Firebase and Google Cloud to secure your applications. After explaining what Firebase and Google Cloud are and why you might use them, we'll dive deep on best practices for using identity based authentication as well as how to configure Firebase Rules and Cloud IAM for least privilege access. We'll also talk about all the work GCP automatically does for you to keep your app secure.</p> <p>Bio: Mike helps developers build better mobile and web apps as a product manager on the Firebase team. Mike has been working on Firebase for four years, and has previously worked developing iOS apps at the Omni Group and building microprocessors at Texas Instruments. In his free time, he enjoys spending time in the outdoors, cooking, and hacking on embedded hardware.</p> <p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>Are you working on something interesting that you want to share?

With pre-trained models, machine learning APIs can analyze or transform our data. Moreover, AutoML techniques can customize these models, solve more specific problems, and provide insights tailored to our own needs. In this session, we'll explore what any developer can do and you’ll be an active player of a live demo. Don't put your smartphone in airplane mode!</p> <p>Bio: Laurent is a developer passionate about software, hardware, science and anything shaping the future. He works for Google where he ecstatically explores cloud technologies. In a previous life, he pioneered the ebook industry, co-created the 1st European ebook reader, and co-founded Bookeen. He now enjoys sharing his passion in international conferences.

He holds a BSc in Computer Science from Hellenic Open University. He has developed during the last 13 years a vast experience both in Front and Back-end with main aspects being the architectural design, the code quality, and the performance.

We will explore the possibilities of the Google Maps Platform and the Google Maps JS API. If you think of any app today, chances are it's using some kind of map. Your app has users, your users have a location, your services are based on that. Still, we find it worrisome to just add that customized, branded, interactive map in our app, because it just might seem too complicated. And we resort to out of the box solutions. Well, good news. The Google Maps JS API is here for you (and it’s been here for the last 15 years, despite you not making the most of it). Today we’ll see how simple it is to add that desired map to your business, brand it to your needs, and go advanced all the way, with this one weird trick that will make leaflet users hate you.</p> <p>Bio: Katerina is a Google Developer Expert for Angular, Web Technologies and the Google Maps Platform, and a software engineer at This Dot. She likes to mix and match web technologies, experimenting with new things, and open sources her code for the general good. Being an active member of the Angular family, she speaks at international conferences and is the co-founder of the Angular Athens meetup. She is also involved with supporting diversity in the community. Katerina is obsessed with sharing knowledge and spreading the word about things she loves. She is indigenous to the internet, and she loves web development. She lives with her Maine Coon in Athens, Greece.</p> <p>twitter: @psybercity<br/>site: psyber.city<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Are you working on something exciting that you want to share?
