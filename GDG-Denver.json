Google has their own unique vision for unlocking the power of proximity-based smart devices called UriBeacon.</p> <p>UriBeacon is an open standard that ties smart beacon devices to the open Web using the most common of resource identifiers: the URI. In this class, we will explore the UriBeacon specification, and how it differs from these other protocols in the marketplace. We will discuss how this specification uniquely integrates with Android’s intent framework for simple app interactions. You will also see examples of how to use the Bluetooth LE APIs to scan for UriBeacon devices in your applications, or turn an Android device into a UriBeacon all its own!</p> <p>Dave Smith (@devunwired) is the Android Practice Lead at NewCircle, where he is focused on developing courseware materials to train beginning and advanced Android developers alike.

We will see how you can use this API to manage a beacon fleet, and extend their usefulness by attaching extra data for your client applications to provide context.

Stories and myths abound about what it's like to work there, mostly true, and for me, working there has been the highlight of my career. Working at Google taught me a ton about software delivery and working efficiently, but also about the risks of working with highly intelligent people, the Silicon Valley bubble effect, and the pains of corporate growth. I'll tell you all about it in this fun and informal session.</p> <p>David fell in love with programming at age 14 on his TI-99/4A, studied electrical engineering at the University of Kansas, and soon after wrote the first published book on Web servers (Running a Perfect Web Site, 1995). He has worked on software for everything from airborne GPS receivers to Internet banking and has written Web applications in everything from C to ColdFusion to JSF and most recently GWT. As a Developer Advocate with Google for 3 years, Chandler supported the worldwide GWT and Android communities through blogging, open source projects, and conference speaking. He actively contributes to open source projects (github: turbomanage) and blogs about Java Web and mobile development at turbomanage.wordpress.com.

The original talk description is below:</p> <p>What the what? Is that a fish in the talk title? Yes. Technically a bass, but we'll get to that in due course.<br/>Alternate Reality Games, as popularized by Nine Inch Nails, Microsoft and others in the real world and Ernest Cline in the amazing novel Ready Player One in the fictional world, are a thing.<br/>What are they? Why do they exist? And most importantly how do you win at them? In Ready Player One billions of dollars are at stake, clans formed, competition was fierce, riddles were solved and a prize awarded.<br/>Much the same happened this year in a promotional stunt involving Google, except the prizes in total were closer to $100,000.<br/>One Denver Software Engineer picked up a fake business card in California and became engrossed in a game that brought him through time and space. Through ridiculous and awesome Zork, Back To The Future and Jurassic Park jokes. Past binary, Base64, waveform and all other matter of riddles. Did he emerge victorious? (spoiler alert: yes) What did he learn? How did different real-world clans work together before and after victory? And who designed the game and for what purpose? Was it a success from their stand point?<br/>All this and more will be covered during this funny, informative and technical talk that can be grok'd by people who don't even know what to grok something means.<br/>The intrepid fish hunter, who caught a time traveling, hacker bass during the 2016 firebase.foo challenge will reveal all the secrets. And maybe even tell you about the time he won a year's worth of free beer, or a novelty five figure check in other technical competitions.<br/>He has previously spoken at every Denver Startup Week, is a local tech community organizer, speaks at national conferences around America, and has given a keynote in Paris and a seminar in Hong Kong. Yet, he'd rather be in dark room hacking for spoils than speaking in front of a group. Public speaking still makes him nervous.<br/>[masked] [masked] [masked] [masked] [masked] [masked] [masked] [masked] [masked] [masked] [masked] [masked] [masked] [masked] [masked] [masked] [masked] &gt; &lt; ( ( ( ° &gt;</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1470954437000,"id":"233294305","name":"GDG DevFest Family Edition at Google Boulder","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1476547200000,"local_date":"2016-10-15","local_time":"10:00","updated":1476802280000,"utc_offset":-21600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":18,"group":{"created":1403044312000,"name":"Google Developer Group (GDG) Denver","id":15151612,"join_mode":"open","lat":39.689998626708984,"lon":-104.91000366210938,"urlname":"GDG-Denver","who":"Members","localized_location":"Denver, CO","state":"CO","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Mountain"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Denver/events/233294305/","description":"<p>This event will require a <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/colorado-devfest-2016-family-edition-tickets-27671084960\">ticket through EventBrite</a>.</p> <p>You can see pictures from last year <a href=\"https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipOHsC8Pkq1S2R4u_5v45d8RI-UtgkiUA16d2uY_bqGYOQjegckCyvyrUVmelGPWJQ?key=bTItdnc5aUZKOEJ6QkRfVi1BanFWTU9nS0FnTTh3\">here</a>.</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1476911104000,"id":"234976414","name":"Google Cardboard and other VR options (Daydream)","rsvp_limit":45,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1479344400000,"local_date":"2016-11-16","local_time":"18:00","updated":1479357222000,"utc_offset":-25200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":42,"group":{"created":1403044312000,"name":"Google Developer Group (GDG) Denver","id":15151612,"join_mode":"open","lat":39.689998626708984,"lon":-104.91000366210938,"urlname":"GDG-Denver","who":"Members","localized_location":"Denver, CO","state":"CO","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Mountain"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Denver/events/234976414/","description":"<p>[Note: Long time member and VR awesome guy Belin will be the host for this meeting, take it easy on him, and don't burn the place down, Mark had a scheduling conflict come up, also thank you to General Assembly for hosting us!]</p> <p>This will be an interactive session to explore available Google Virtual Reality tools.  We'll have a lot of Google Cardboards on hand you can use with your own smart phone.  We'll have a list of fun Cardboard apps available in the Play Store.  We'll crowdsource development stories.</p> <p>This will be more of a play and hang out session than a formal presentation.</p> <p>We will have a local Unity developer on site with laptop to share how 3d experiences can be programmed with Unity!</p> <p><b>UPDATE:</b> <i>We'll have Google Daydream available to try out!</i></p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1480998235000,"duration":9000000,"id":"236060941","name":"Android 101","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1481158800000,"local_date":"2016-12-07","local_time":"18:00","updated":1481169150000,"utc_offset":-25200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":4,"venue":{"id":24673365,"name":"General Assembly","lat":39.75844955444336,"lon":-105.00762176513672,"repinned":false,"address_1":"2420 17th St, 3rd Floor","city":"Denver","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"","state":"CO"},"group":{"created":1403044312000,"name":"Google Developer Group (GDG) Denver","id":15151612,"join_mode":"open","lat":39.689998626708984,"lon":-104.91000366210938,"urlname":"GDG-Denver","who":"Members","localized_location":"Denver, CO","state":"CO","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Mountain"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Denver/events/236060941/","description":"<p>Come join a free class taught by the GDG Denver organizer, make sure to RSVP at this link:</p> <p><a href=\"https://generalassemb.ly/education/android-programming-101/denver/30694\" class=\"linkified\">https://generalassemb.ly/education/android-programming-101/denver/30694</a></p> <p>Android Programming 101<br/>7 Wednesday, 7 December</p> <p>6 – 8:30 pm MST<br/>GA Denver, WeWork LoHi</p> <p>[masked]th Street, 3rd Floor<br/>Denver , CO 80202<br/>FREE!<br/>Regular Ticket<br/>Attend</p> <p>Can’t Make It?</p> <p>Follow this workshop to get an email the next time it’s scheduled.<br/>Sign-up not required<br/>Follow Follow<br/>Questions?

Starting out as a freelancer, she slowly worked her way up to a traditional business model, learning along the way the ins and outs of running a business, such as client, project and employee management and strategic marketing. KL Creative has grown in leaps and bounds with sales doubling in the last two years alone. Never content with the status quo, Kristy Lee continually teaches herself new skills and challenges herself to move out of her comfort zone.</i></p> <p><i><br/></i> <i>Unsatisfied with existing web development software, Kristy Lee learned WordPress plugin development and has created several plugins that are in regular use. She also mastered iPhone development, an entirely different programming language, and created an iPhone app with over 12K downloads.

For those unfamiliar, Dagger 2 is a dependency injection framework provided by the fine folks at Square and Google. As many are aware, time and time again Dagger has been covered at countless meetups, conferences, and in blog posts.</p> <p>Those familiar with the library should understand that this is not by chance. The library offers the promise of a cleaner, decoupled, and more testable code-base. This promise is, arguably, the main reason that Dagger 2 is perhaps the most ubiquitous library that exists on our platform. But we're not here to explain or rationalize why you should use Dagger. Instead, we're here to address the elephant in the room. You might be asking, \"There's an elephant in the room? Where?\" If you have watched some of the recent talks given by leaders in our community, perhaps you'll see what we mean. Take, for example \"Swordfighting with Dagger\", \"Dagger 2 Android: Defeat the Dahaka\", or \"Demystifying Dependency Injection.\" These talks (and their titles) capture what it often feels like to work with Dagger. We're on the front lines, in the trenches, not working with the library, but rather fighting against some magical, mythical beast that needs to be slayed.</p> <p>Which brings us to this talk. This talk is not a call to arms and does not attempt to throw down any type of gauntlet. In fact, this talk does the exact opposite. It's time to raise the white flag and talk about the terms of our surrender. Let's stop fighting with a tool we all use on a daily basis and learn how to peacefully coexist.</p> <p>With the release of Dagger 2.11, there are now Android-specific modules that are designed to make the library easier to use, require less boilerplate, and in general, make our lives better. We wish that we could tell you that the path to easy street only requires you to take a deep breath, grab a cold refreshment, and update Dagger in your Gradle configuration.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the recent versions of Dagger require a somewhat major change in how we approach and use the tool. Practices and techniques that were once widely used, even encouraged are now practically anti-patterns. Through a Kotlin-focused lens, join us as we take a deep breath, take off the boxing gloves, put down our weapons, and raise the white flag. We're hoping that by the end of the evening, you'll wonder, \"What were we fighting for?\"</p> <p>• What to bring<br/>Your spirit, mind, and any and all Dagger-related questions.</p> <p>• About the presenters</p> <p>Joe Thorngren is an Android developer that just migrated from Denver to Chicago. He enjoys playing with his two dogs, learning about all things Linux, and recently picked up a LulzBot 3D Printer. He is always on the lookout for a new munch spot and especially loves Sushi and Tacos. Steven Gerdes is an Android Developer from Chicago, IL. When he's not cruising Lake Shore Drive with his windows down, he's most likely working in Android Studio, exploring cool new Android libraries or listening to NPR, the latest Fragmented episode or The Beach Boys on vinyl.</p> <p>Both Joe and Steven work as Android Developers at Tack Mobile, a Denver-based client services company focusing on all things mobile, IoT, and Augmented Reality.</p> <p>• DIRECTIONS</p> <p>* General Assembly @ INDUSTRY RiNo Station, 3858 Walnut St, Denver,<br/>CO 80205 [1]</p> <p>* The building entrance faces southeast.

This library has been around for about 6 years. In that time the Google Polymer development team’s focus has always been about allowing folks like us to understand changes in store for the web before those changes even arrive; so that when these changes do happen, we still look good and feel on top. Of late the Polymer team has focused on PWA issues and has gotten our mobile web apps arriving and usable in just a few seconds with minimal headache!</p> <p>Polymer 3.0 takes the amazing work done by this Google team and moves it even further into the modern JavaScript era with ES2015 modules and NPM, once again giving us a jump on what browser vendors are planning on doing to and with the web.</p> <p>This talk will walk through a PWA demo app built in Polymer 3 by Michael Fons. During and after the demo we will discuss lessons learned and observations about the mobile web in general.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Michael Fons is a Denver-ite who has surfed the IT industry since 1990. Lately his focus professionally has been on PWA’s and Google Polymer at home and AngularJS and Web and Java Development at work.

From the days of Selenium to Webdriver, and now Protractor written specifically for Angular, this type of testing has taken far too much time and has been largely unproductive. The tests take too long to run and fail intermittently for no apparent reason at all. It's difficult to test features of an application without spending lots of time setting up \"magic data\" scenarios so we can verify that each aspect our application works as expected. This arduous process leads many developers to frustration and eventually resigning to using E2E testing for simple smoke tests.</p> <p>No More!</p> <p>Introducing Cypress.io, a new way of doing E2E tests that makes life incredibly simple and easy to manage. Cypress allows developers to focus on what's important and get the results we want without having to jump through a million hoops. We will be exploring what Cypress.io has to offer, how to set it up, and how it will change how you look at E2E tests.</p> <p>**** Speaker Bio ****<br/>Jesse Sanders is the founder and CEO of BrieBug and a Google Developer Expert (GDE) in Angular and Web Technologies. He regularly speaks around the world on Angular and related web technologies to inform and inspire developers on how to build the next generation of web applications. He regularly teaches workshops on Angular fundamentals, NgRx, and advanced Angular topics. He specializes in architecting systems using Angular for enterprise clients to help them achieve their goals.
