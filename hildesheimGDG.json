And as part of the GDG-Hildesheim, you’re among the first to know about this!!</p> <p>The Community Speedrun Challenge is a training program that will run in May where you’ll have the opportunity to join four Speedruns and get hands-on experience with Machine Learning on Google Cloud and Tensorflow, and take your first steps with tools like BigQuery, Cloud Speech API, and Cloud ML Engine. Every Speedrun is open for a week to give you the ability to finish all labs in your best time, scoring more points and winning prizes.</p> <p>Find more information and register here:<br/><a href=\"https://events.withgoogle.com/communityspeedrunchallenge/\" class=\"linkified\">https://events.withgoogle.com/communityspeedrunchallenge/</a></p> <p>Speedrun #3: Intermediate ML: TensorFlow on GCP</p> <p>Labs: Machine Learning with TensorFlow, TensorFlow for Poets, Predict Housing Prices with Tensorflow and AI Platform, Predict Baby Weight with TensorFlow on AI Platform<br/>Timeframe: May 18th-24th<br/>Leaderboard (TBC)<br/>Webinar<br/>May 18th,[masked] (GMT+02)<br/>Lab: TBC</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false}],"upcoming":[{"created":1579915406000,"duration":10800000,"id":"268182510","name":"Study Jams- Tensorflow, Kubernetes, Image Processing On GCP","rsvp_limit":30,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"upcoming","time":1590760800000,"local_date":"2020-05-29","local_time":"16:00","rsvp_close_offset":"PT24H","updated":1589208224000,"utc_offset":7200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":22,"venue":{"id":26906060,"name":"Online event","repinned":true,"country":"","localized_country_name":""},"is_online_event":true,"group":{"created":1536058070000,"name":"GDG Hildesheim","id":29705647,"join_mode":"open","lat":52.15999984741211,"lon":9.949999809265137,"urlname":"hildesheimGDG","who":"Members","localized_location":"Hildesheim, Germany","state":"","country":"de","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Berlin"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/hildesheimGDG/events/268182510/","description":"<p>A Community Event<br/>Study Jams are community-run study groups for developers. This is a great opportunity to learn something in person. These training will give you a specific skill they can use for personal development or career advancement.</p> <p>Want to get started on the Google Cloud, but don't know where to begin? Join us for our Cloud Study Jam!</p> <p>Get official Google training, a $55+ value, free of charge. Together we'll work through several Google Cloud labs. You will get hands-on experience with the Cloud Console, Kubernetes, Security, IoT on Cloud, and Machine Learning. Then after our live session, you will have free access to more labs you can finish at home. Complete all labs in the quest and earn a Google-hosted badge for your online profile, and additional 30 days access to the training platform to compete with any labs you want.</p> <p>You can choose any of our recommended tracks to run with your community: Machine Learning, Kubernetes, Certification, IoT, and Security.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.qwiklabs.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.qwiklabs.com/</a></p> <p>After the session, attendees can continue taking labs to earn Google Cloud badges.</p> <p>If you have used Qwiklabs before, great!
