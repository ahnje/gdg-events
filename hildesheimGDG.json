In small teams of two to four, coders all over the world will tackle the first problem through an Online Qualification Round. Though this round is hosted online, teams can come together to compete side-by-side in locally coordinated Hash Code hubs. The top teams from this round are invited to join us at an international Google office for our annual Hash Code Final Round.</p> <p>If you’re interested in joining our hub, find a team (2 to 4 people) and be sure you all register at <a href=\"https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode/\" class=\"linkified\">https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode/</a><br/>You’ll then need to select [GDG Uni-Hildesheim] from the list of hubs in the Judge System.</p> <p>For More Information</p> <p><a href=\"https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode/rulesandterms\" class=\"linkified\">https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode/rulesandterms</a></p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1551198824000,"duration":28800000,"id":"259298107","name":"Google Cloud Study Jams- ML,IoT","rsvp_limit":20,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1553425200000,"local_date":"2019-03-24","local_time":"12:00","updated":1553458508000,"utc_offset":3600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":14,"venue":{"id":26270575,"name":"Hansering 1B","lat":52.14957046508789,"lon":9.954595565795898,"repinned":false,"address_1":"ground floor, Studentenwerk","address_2":"31141","city":"Hildesheim","country":"DE","localized_country_name":"Germany"},"group":{"created":1536058070000,"name":"GDG Hildesheim","id":29705647,"join_mode":"open","lat":52.15999984741211,"lon":9.949999809265137,"urlname":"hildesheimGDG","who":"Members","localized_location":"Hildesheim, Germany","state":"","country":"de","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Berlin"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/hildesheimGDG/events/259298107/","description":"<p>A Community Event<br/>Study Jams are community-run study groups for developers.
