However, not everyone has the AI/ML nor math background to jump straight into scikit-learn or TensorFlow. In this session, learn how to access the machine learning APIs available from the Google Cloud Platform. Examples will be done in Python for brevity, but many languages are supported.</p> <p>LONG DESCRIPTION<br/>We live in an era of big data, and modern tools have been developed to help analyze this vast amount of data as well as using data to discover new, never-before-seen patterns. Developers are using analysis tools to query data, but also machine learning to discern patterns that weren't possible before. With scikit-learn, pandas, PyTorch, and TensorFlow, the possibilities are endless. However, not everyone has the AI/ML nor math background to jump straight into tools like those. In this session, attendees will learn how to *use* machine learning through a set of APIs provided in the Google Cloud Platform.</p> <p>By being a user of machine learning, developers will learn the terminology and the steps necessary to one day be able to fully build &amp; train their own machine learning models then validate &amp; deploy them to make predictions on new data. This session provides an easier on-ramp to working with machine learning by taking advantage of Google's pre-trained models accessible via API.</p> <p>The specific APIs covered include the Google Cloud...<br/>Natural Language API<br/>Vision API<br/>Speech-to-Text API<br/>Text-to-Speech API<br/>Video Intelligence API<br/>BigQuery API<br/>Each API will be demonstrated in Python for brevity. (Other languages are supported of course.) Finally, the AutoML feature will be introduced, allowing developers to customize and further train the models behind Google's ML APIs so that they're more appropriate for your data and being able to do so without a sophisticated machine learning background.</p> <p>LEARNING OBJECTIVES<br/>Get a high-level overview and introduction to machine learning<br/>Become familiar with the machine learning APIs in Google Cloud Platform<br/>Learn how to use those APIs<br/>Be exposed to the AutoML feature (of some APIs)</p> <p>Speaker<br/>WESLEY CHUN<br/>DEVELOPER ADVOCATE CYBERWEB &amp; GOOGLE<br/>+WESLEY CHUN, MSCS, is the author of Prentice Hall's bestselling \"Core Python\" book series &amp; companion videos (corepython.com), co-author of \"Python Web Development with Django\" (withdjango.com), and has written for Linux Journal, CNET, and InformIT.
