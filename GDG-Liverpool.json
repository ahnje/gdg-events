When directed at the right sort of problem and executed well, DDD is a valid solution. But DDD is over-used, misunderstood, misapplied, deified, and just downright bastardized. It is a small core concept that has gargantuan consequences throughout the solution.</p> <p>Thankfully, there are alternatives. By following the Single Responsibility Principle at an architectural level, we can create a suite of small, decoupled services with high internal cohesion. These services can be composed and orchestrated in many different ways to solve business problems.</p> <p><b>Speaker: Gary McLean Hall</b></p> <p>Develop and Architect. Author of \"Adaptive Code via C#\" and \"Pro WPF and Silverlight MVVM\". Very sporadic tweeter. Code pedant. Frustrated game developer gone corporate.</p> <p><b>Venturing into the unknown building TendoJobs.com</b></p> <p>A talk by Michael Cropper, founder of Tendo Jobs, which looks at the technical aspects behind building a tech startup. Starting with the skills required to bring your idea to life, should you be a specialist or a generalist? Then looking at the underlying frameworks, technologies and design patterns required to build solid foundations for growth and scale while keeping things as simple as possible to avoid technical pitfalls. Through to how to deal with the inherent unpredictability of software development to avoid wasting endless time debugging problems that should have never existed in the first place. Looking through the entire process, pitfalls we’ve experienced and how we minimise risk throughout our development using the Model View Controller (MVC) design pattern.</p> <p><b>Speaker: </b>Michael Cropper</p> <p>Michael Cropper is the Managing Director of Digital Agency Contrado Digital and technology startup Tendo Jobs.

If you are like us, those compromises are not worthwhile and it has prevented you from being able to use any of those solutions for your projects.</p> <p>Even if we can’t use a cross platform solution there is a lot we can do to improve the concurrent development of an app on both iOS and Android.</p> <p>We will show you a push-based architecture that can allow us to use the same terminology and design on both platform. Using Firebase and Reactive Extensions we can create a codebase that is so similar on both platforms that communication is much easier.</p> <p>We can pair across platforms and when business rules have to change or when bugs are identified it is easy to modify both platforms as the change is virtually the same.</p> <p><b>Follow him: </b>@Dorvaryn</p> <p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>📧 If you’re interested in speaking, getting involved, sponsoring or have some feedback, drop us an email: </p> <p>[masked]</p> <p><b>Follow us: </b>@gdg_liverpool </p> <p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>See you there! </p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1484220667000,"id":"236870578","name":"March GDG Liverpool","rsvp_limit":60,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1490720400000,"local_date":"2017-03-28","local_time":"18:00","updated":1490733393000,"utc_offset":3600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":40,"venue":{"id":15523152,"name":"Baltic Creative (Unit 51)","lat":53.395938873291016,"lon":-2.9806160926818848,"repinned":false,"address_1":"Jamaica Street","city":"Liverpool","country":"gb","localized_country_name":"United Kingdom"},"group":{"created":1436540222000,"name":"Google Developer Group Liverpool","id":18732133,"join_mode":"open","lat":53.41999816894531,"lon":-2.990000009536743,"urlname":"GDG-Liverpool","who":"Members","localized_location":"Liverpool, United Kingdom","state":"28","country":"gb","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/London"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Liverpool/events/236870578/","description":"<p><b>Join us for the March GDG Liverpool Meetup! </b>Where the local tech community comes together to listen to expert speakers, find out more about the latest advances, followed by a good pub social.  </p> <p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><b>This months agenda: </b></p> <p>6:00pm – Arrive to food, drinks &amp; welcome</p> <p>6.30pm - Hello's &amp; introduction</p> <p>6.40pm – Android Things - Paul Blundell &amp; Xavi Rigau </p> <p>7.40pm – Pub!</p> <p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p><b>Talk: Android Things</b></p> <p>Android Things is Googles latest foray into the Internet of Things.

It's concise, statically typed and runs on the JVM, and it's one of the fastest growing languages in the world, according to the Tiobe Index. Come along and see what it can do.</p> <p>We've chosen to put Kotlin and our TDD skills through their paces by going over a classic kata from Uncle Bob Martin. Using only tests to guide us, we'll (hopefully) code up a fully working app that can keep score of a ten pin bowling game.</p> <p>We'll be following the guidelines of TDD by using ping pong pairing - one person writing a failing test, the other making it pass, then switching.</p> <p>For those of you that aren't familiar with test-driven approaches, this is an ideal opportunity to see how they can benefit you. </p> <p>For those that are familiar with TDD, it's an ideal opportunity to come and tell us where we're going wrong!</p> <p><b>What to bring: </b></p> <p>This is a live coding demonstration so you won't need to bring along your laptop, but if you want to code along with what we're doing you're more than welcome.

She will be bringing this talk to you after presenting it at Droidcon Berlin 2019.</p> <p>Talk abstract:</p> <p>\"Across the mobile industry, there is often this great divide between the two platforms, iOS, and Android. The consumer arguments of which side is better, and what phones are better regularly leak into our work and quite frankly taint our ability to make great applications for our users. As developers, we are sometimes subject to the whims and biases of designers and product managers. However, we have to take responsibility for ensuring that our mobile products as a whole are enjoyable and consistent for our users. At Monzo, there is a culture of collaboration, which has resulted in the mobile apps becoming closer and closer in feature parity. However, there are still issues, and definitely lessons from the past, which I will detail in this talk. I will also delve into the issues with the more black and white thought processes that plague the industry, what damage they can cause and how much of a detriment to your product they can be. She will then go on to explain how, by working together and appreciating the benefits of both sides, you can ultimately design and build apps that everybody will love, and also be happier in our work.</p> <p>Venue: The Baltic Roastery</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false}],"upcoming":[],"organizers":[{"id":191258458,"name":"Niamh P.","bio":"Mobile Engineer @ Monzo, working remotely in North Wales!
