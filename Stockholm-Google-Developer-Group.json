Nor did we have an old system to port, we did have an old system but no requirements to salvage any of the code.</p> <p>So starting out with an ambition to be completely serverless we have had quite a few lessons learned, pitfalls avoided and benefits gained.

This strategy is called Continuous Integration, and it has become standard fare for backend and web developers.</p> <p>Continuous Integration is much more difficult to accomplish on mobile apps due to the way they are packaged and distributed. The app store model, while convenient for the customer, almost seems to be designed to prevent it. The app bundle is a single large binary that you can't push too often. Or can you?</p> <p>I'll talk about how Lyft builds, tests and releases apps on a weekly basis with high quality. Our mix of homegrown and off-the-shelf build systems, test harnesses combined with feature flags and a careful release process makes it possible to get close to Continuous Integration for mobile.</p> <p>More details soon!</p> ","how_to_find_us":"Valtech is located one block away from Stockholm City Hall (where the Nobel prices are dished out)","visibility":"public"},{"created":1477818474000,"id":"235214087","name":"GDG Meetup November 2016","rsvp_limit":80,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1479837600000,"local_date":"2016-11-22","local_time":"19:00","updated":1480011974000,"utc_offset":3600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":70,"venue":{"id":24816334,"name":"Foo Café, IIS Internetstiftelsen i Sverige","lat":59.3071174621582,"lon":18.075950622558594,"repinned":false,"address_1":"Building A1, 9th floor, Ringvägen 100","city":"Stockholm","country":"se","localized_country_name":"Sweden"},"group":{"created":1449041703000,"name":"Stockholm Google Developer Group","id":19174366,"join_mode":"open","lat":59.33000183105469,"lon":18.06999969482422,"urlname":"Stockholm-Google-Developer-Group","who":"GDGers","localized_location":"Stockholm, Sweden","state":"","country":"se","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Stockholm"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/Stockholm-Google-Developer-Group/events/235214087/","description":"<p>Food &amp; Drinks: Yes</p> <p>Agenda:</p> <p> <br/>1) Johan Mjönes (Uprise) - Using Zipkin to profile distributed systems</p> <p>2) Peter Svensson talks a bit about interesting services you might not know about.</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1484561162000,"id":"236959999","name":"GDG Stockholm Language bash!","rsvp_limit":90,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1486054800000,"local_date":"2017-02-02","local_time":"18:00","updated":1486400212000,"utc_offset":3600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":76,"venue":{"id":15544192,"name":"Valtech AB","lat":59.32892990112305,"lon":18.064910888671875,"repinned":false,"address_1":"Kungliga Myntet","address_2":"Hantverkargatan 5","city":"Stockholm","country":"se","localized_country_name":"Sweden"},"group":{"created":1449041703000,"name":"Stockholm Google Developer Group","id":19174366,"join_mode":"open","lat":59.33000183105469,"lon":18.06999969482422,"urlname":"Stockholm-Google-Developer-Group","who":"GDGers","localized_location":"Stockholm, Sweden","state":"","country":"se","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Stockholm"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/Stockholm-Google-Developer-Group/events/236959999/","description":"<p>It's time for the annual language bash once again.

A lot of people are migrating (or planning to migrate) to it, but this architecture is little to unknown to many people. Various solutions exist on the market and they all do more or less the same thing, but the questions is where to start from ? which solution to pick ? Managed or Un-managed ?In this talk we will explore Google Cloud Pub/Sub, a highly available, infinitely scalable, low latency messaging system built for Cloud, we will look at the concepts of Cloud Pub/Sub and use it to build a Microservice architecture.</p> <p><b>Bio</b></p> <p>SGHIOUAR Abdellfetah (Abdel for short) is a Google Strategic Cloud Engineer, he works with customers helping them achieve success on there journey to the Cloud. with 10+ years of experience, from Google Datacenters to startups, from product development to DevOps and operations, he has a deep understanding of the challenges that companies of all sizes face everyday with their product.</p> <p>2) 19:15 - 20:00</p> <p>\"<b>Achieving Business Agility by Agile Architecture</b>\"  by Mina Boström Nakicenovic from NetEnt </p> <p><b>Abstract</b>:</p> <p>Once upon a time few believed that big up-front design methodologies, like Model-Driven Development (MDD), could be used in agile software development due to their complexity and long starting curve. This story describes how we successfully reduced the complexity of the MDD concept, by applying agile principles and lean startup methodology. We managed to produce a working MDD solution, which created business value within a short time-frame. Such an agile MDD architectural solution, although being a “worse” solution compared to a technically perfect one, was in fact a better solution since it delivered business value.</p> <p>And this was not the end - the story continues. We used our MDD architecture to build an internally developed computer virus - but a well-intentioned one! We applied the “minimum viable solution” concept when developing it. The mentioned virus spreads across the whole system and does a lot of useful things. Curious to know more? Welcome to my talk!</p> <p>This talk will provoke you to think about a well-known question “Is Worse Better?” It demonstrates “how worse can be better” if the focus is on delivering a business value.</p> <p><b>Bio</b>:</p> <p>Mina works as Head of NEL Development at NetEnt.

The five commandments of the software world. Forgotten for years, as developers focused on JavaScript frameworks with stupid names and complicated patterns. Not grasping that the SOLID principles transcend beyond frameworks and patterns.<br/>The SOLID principles are the foundation of building good software. They are the breakers of monoliths. The decouplers of coupling. The squashers of regression bugs. One might even say that they are the creators of maintainable code.<br/>Unless you already a believer, you need to attend this session and get on the right path. Chris, the bringer of SOLID knowledge, will go through each one of the principles, explaining what it means, what it will do for you, and why you should stop breaking it. You will even be shown C# code that explains how they help you, and what problems will haunt you if you ignore them and are faced with their wrath.</p> <p>Bio:</p> <p>Chris Klug is a developer-badass-as-a-service that either creates or solves problems depending on who you ask. He loves creating and building things. Whether it be a new application, a new kitchen or a new RC helicopter, you will see him building things all the time. Most of the time, that means writing code and solving problems for clients at a company called tretton37 in Stockholm though. Except for the many days he spends at conferences and user groups, talking about doing things he is passionate about, and for the days he goes mountain biking, IPSC shooting, kiteboarding or RC helicopter flying.</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1527614460000,"duration":10800000,"id":"251207293","name":"GDG June/Summer 2018","rsvp_limit":60,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1528385400000,"local_date":"2018-06-07","local_time":"17:30","updated":1528402764000,"utc_offset":7200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":48,"venue":{"id":25583878,"name":"R2M","lat":59.33070755004883,"lon":18.053142547607422,"repinned":false,"address_1":"Klarabergsviadukten 90 C, 5 tr","city":"Stockholm","country":"se","localized_country_name":"Sweden"},"group":{"created":1449041703000,"name":"Stockholm Google Developer Group","id":19174366,"join_mode":"open","lat":59.33000183105469,"lon":18.06999969482422,"urlname":"Stockholm-Google-Developer-Group","who":"GDGers","localized_location":"Stockholm, Sweden","state":"","country":"se","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Stockholm"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/Stockholm-Google-Developer-Group/events/251207293/","description":"<p>17.30 - 18.00 Doors open, food and drinks served, mingle.<br/>18:00 - 18:40 Introduction to ReasonML: functional programming for Javascript developers by Andreas Eldh</p> <p>Abstract:<br/>ReasonML is an exciting new programming language aimed at Javascript developers.
