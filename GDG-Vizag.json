Here are some more details,</p> <p>What can I expect from this workshop?</p> <p>In this workshop, you will experience the entire product development lifecycle, right from getting a feature request from your product manager, to building, testing, and pushing the feature out, in a work-like environment, with guidance from Tech Leads and the Crio Platform. While going through this, you will sharpen your understanding of key concepts like Serialisation, Consuming 3rd Party Rest APIs, Interfaces and more.</p> <p>You will also get to interact with Ajay Ravindra, Founding Member of Crio.Do, on what it takes to “Succeed in Software”</p> <p>Why is Crio.Do conducting this workshop?</p> <p>Crio.Do is an applied learning platform where developers ‘learn by doing’. On the platform, developers go through structured work-like experiences, where they address real product development scenarios, just like professional product developers. While doing so, they learn the relevant tech involved in the process of building real products.</p> <p>How is this workshop conducted? What do I need to know beforehand for the workshop?</p> <p>This is a completely online/remote workshop where you will work in a fully provisioned development environment on the Crio platform. You will have access to our Tech Leads via Forum. Stand Up’s, Debriefs and Knowledge Sharing sessions will be conducted on Zoom. The workshop will be on Python, so basic Python knowledge is a prerequisite.</p> <p>Registration on first come basis</p> <p>Do register at - <a href=\"https://bit.ly/crio-gdg-vizag\" class=\"linkified\">https://bit.ly/crio-gdg-vizag</a></p> <p>RSVP wont be considered.. only registrations at mentioned link are valid.</p> ","how_to_find_us":"meet.google.com/zmy-fhda-nuf","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1588946879000,"duration":3600000,"id":"270526885","name":"Delving deep into the basics of Facial Recognition","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1589520600000,"local_date":"2020-05-15","local_time":"11:00","updated":1589527159000,"utc_offset":19800000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":20,"venue":{"id":26906060,"name":"Online event","repinned":false,"country":"","localized_country_name":""},"is_online_event":true,"group":{"created":1531816033000,"name":"GDG-Vizag","id":29275204,"join_mode":"open","lat":17.729999542236328,"lon":83.30000305175781,"urlname":"GDG-Vizag","who":"Members","localized_location":"Visakhapatnam, India","state":"","country":"in","region":"en_US","timezone":"Asia/Calcutta"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Vizag/events/270526885/","description":"<p>Dear Members,</p> <p>GDG Vizag is happy to announce an online interactive event on \"Delving deep into the basics of Facial Recognition\".
