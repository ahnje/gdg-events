In this session, you'll learn recent changes to Firebase that are specifically targeted towards building large-scale applications with complex development teams. By the end of this session, you'll see how you can take advantage of the power of Firebase in your app right now. (45 min.)</p> <p>About Jacob:<br/>Jacob is a Software Engineer on the Firebase team. He works on the backend of Firebase console, which builds the platform to support various Firebase product teams.</p> <p>Talk 2<br/>Integrating Firebase into your existing infrastructure by Hiranya Jayathilaka (Twitter: @hiranya911)</p> <p>Developing feature-rich apps often requires integrating with heterogeneous backend systems. Firebase and Google Cloud provide several features that make such integrations simpler. We'll explore how to access Firebase data and user accounts from your existing backend systems. We'll also demonstrate how to develop new serverless components in different programming languages to add new capabilities to your apps. You will learn how to manage your app's user accounts, respond to critical application events, and enrich Firebase data from backend components deployed in environments like App Engine and Cloud Functions, as well as environments that you maintain and control. (45 min.)</p> <p>About Hiranya:<br/>Hiranya is a tech lead on the Firebase team. He works on the Firebase Admin SDKs, which enable server-side and backend integrations of Firebase. Prior to joining Google, Hiranya worked as a software engineer at WSO2, where he developed open source enterprise integration and API management technologies. He is a committer and a project management committee member for several Apache projects. Hiranya earned a bachelor’s degree in engineering from University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. He also received a Ph.D. in computer science from the University of California, Santa Barbara.</p> <p>After the talks there will as always be some time to network and chat.
