In small teams of two to four, coders all over the world will tackle the first problem through an Online Qualification Round.<br/>Teams come together to compete side-by-side in locally coordinated Hash Code hubs. The top teams from this round are invited to join us at an international Google office for our annual Hash Code Final Round.</p> <p>Problems are modeled on Google engineering challenges. Past problems have included perfecting video streaming on YouTube and optimizing the layout of a Google data center: <a href=\"https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode/archive\" class=\"linkified\">https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode/archive</a></p> <p>You can compete with your friends. You need to form a team of 2 to 4 people to compete in Hash Code. If you don’t have a team, don’t worry! Come to the venue, you may create your own team then and there itself. Or find teammates later using our Facebook group: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/GoogleHashCode/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.facebook.com/groups/GoogleHashCode/</a></p> <p>The World Finals will be hosted at Google Ireland. Top teams from the Online Qualification Round will be invited to Dublin in April to compete for cash prizes and the title of Hash Code 2020 Champion.</p> <p>Make sure you don't miss out on the action by first creating a Coding Competitions profile for 2020, and then registering for Hash Code 2020.
