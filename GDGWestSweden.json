In small teams of two to four, coders all over the world will tackle the first problem through an Online Qualification Round.<br/>Teams come together to compete side-by-side in locally coordinated Hash Code hubs. The top teams from this round are invited to join us at an international Google office for our annual Hash Code Final Round.</p> <p>Problems are modeled on Google engineering challenges. Past problems have included perfecting video streaming on YouTube and optimizing the layout of a Google data center: <a href=\"https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode/archive\" class=\"linkified\">https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode/archive</a></p> <p>You can compete with your friends. You need to form a team of 2 to 4 people to compete in Hash Code. If you don’t have a team, don’t worry! Come to the venue, you may create your own team then and there itself. Or find teammates later using our Facebook group: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/GoogleHashCode/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.facebook.com/groups/GoogleHashCode/</a></p> <p>The World Finals will be hosted at Google Ireland. Top teams from the Online Qualification Round will be invited to Dublin in April to compete for cash prizes and the title of Hash Code 2020 Champion.</p> <p>Make sure you don't miss out on the action by first creating a Coding Competitions profile for 2020, and then registering for Hash Code 2020.

Easily create visual narratives, with engaging animations and tappable interactions. The AMP story format is free and part of the open web and is available for everyone to try on their websites. They can be shared and embedded across the web without being confined to a closed ecosystem or platform.</p> <p>AMP stories provide content publishers with a mobile-focused format for delivering news and information as visually rich, tap-through stories. AMP Stories offers a robust set of advertising opportunities for advertisers and publishers to reach a unique audience on the web with immersive experiences.</p> <p>For any queries please reach out to us:<br/>Prajit: [masked] / [masked]</p> ","how_to_find_us":"https://zoom.us/meeting/register/v5ckduGrrzwuB4ED5qA48oXSl_AGJDkJvg ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1584795024000,"duration":3600000,"id":"bzrbrrybcgbpb","name":"Online Community Study Circle | Google ML TensorFlow Developer Certification","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1586617200000,"local_date":"2020-04-11","local_time":"17:00","updated":1586622418000,"utc_offset":7200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":24,"venue":{"id":26906060,"name":"Online event","repinned":true,"country":"","localized_country_name":""},"is_online_event":true,"group":{"created":1571949732000,"name":"Google Developers Group - GDG West Sweden","id":32934039,"join_mode":"open","lat":57.720001220703125,"lon":12.010000228881836,"urlname":"GDGWestSweden","who":"Learners","localized_location":"Göteborg, Sweden","state":"","country":"se","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Stockholm"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDGWestSweden/events/bzrbrrybcgbpb/","description":"<p>This is a community study circle program by GDG West Sweden, where participants will discuss and mutually agree upon to set study goals for a period of 2 weeks (Alternative Saturdays: 17:00 -18:00) till 20th June (as of now).</p> <p>A self-study approach with the help of online course materials available at Google's learning platforms, MOOCs.

Without adding a lot of dependencies we get a convenient setup to cover most of our everyday use cases.<br/>We will see how this environment works under the hood. We will also get a better understanding of our testing tool-set, seeing how it interacts with the framework</p> <p>Agenda:<br/>------<br/>5:30-5:45 Introductions and recap - Chat app (by Sumith Damodaran)<br/>5:45-6:45 Flutter testing! What to consider (by Rafał Ślósarz)</p> <p>Rafał is Flutter and Android developer with experience in creating and leading development teams in startups.

This certificate in TensorFlow development is intended as a foundational certificate for students, developers, and data scientists who want to demonstrate practical machine learning skills through the building and training of models using TensorFlow.</p> <p>The program consists of an assessment exam developed by the TensorFlow team. Developers who pass the exam can join our Certificate Network and display their certificate and badges on their resume, GitHub, and social media platforms including LinkedIn, making it easy to share their level of TensorFlow expertise with the world.</p> <p>Who is the TensorFlow Certificate for?<br/>-----------------------------------<br/>This level one certificate exam tests a developers foundational knowledge of integrating machine learning into tools and applications. The certificate program requires an understanding of building TensorFlow models using Computer Vision, Convolutional Neural Networks, Natural Language Processing, and real-world image data and strategies.</p> <p>In order to successfully take the exam, test takers should be comfortable with:</p> <p>a) Foundational principles of ML and Deep Learning<br/>b) Building ML models in TensorFlow<br/>c) Building image recognition, object detection, text recognition algorithms with deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks<br/>d) Using real-world images in different shapes and sizes to visualize the journey of an image through convolutions to understand how a computer “sees” information, plot loss and accuracy<br/>e) Exploring strategies to prevent overfitting, including augmentation and dropouts<br/>f) Applying neural networks to solve natural language processing problems using TensorFlow</p> <p>Benefits<br/>----------<br/>a) Learn something new. Increase your proficiency in machine learning, and test your abilities with the TensorFlow assessment exam.<br/>b) Receive community recognition. Be recognized by others in the global TensorFlow community.<br/>c) Showcase your skills. Share your certificate on your resume and social networking platforms like LinkedIn to be recognized as a top candidate for recruiters seeking entry-level TensorFlow developers.<br/>d) Find TensorFlow talent.
