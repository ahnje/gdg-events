Launching the stuff that will be driving the technology debate for the next 12 months. A Be-There or Be-Square conference. Wanna Go?</p> <p>Well you don’t have to pay for a plane ticket. Come along to Google I/O Extended, right here in Reading. We’re having a party, with Tee-shirts and goodies and a few beers while we watch the action. The keynote is over 2 hours long, so expect plenty of cool, new stuff.</p> <p>What might we see? Techradar reckons I/O 2015 will reinvigorate developer, press and consumer imaginations. Here’s some of their predictions…</p> <p><b>A dozen Highlights – or not</b><br/>1. A new version of Android<br/>2. Android TV<br/>3. A new Chromecast<br/>4. Android Wearables<br/>5. A new Google Glass<br/>6. Internet of Things<br/>7. A modular mobile – choose your own spec<br/>8. A tablet with VR, AR and 3D mapping<br/>9. A Virtual Reality Headset<br/>10. Android Auto<br/>11. A Wallet upgrade<br/>12. And something in fitness and health</p> <p><b>Android M – a new Mobile OS for Business</b><br/>An Android at Work session description that's since been pulled from the Google IO website reveals Google plans to announce Android M, the next version of its mobile OS, during the 2015 conference. The description offered few details - it \"brings power of Android to all kinds of workplaces.\" We expect it will do much more.</p> <p><b>Android TV</b><br/>Google TV is dead, - long live Android TV. Google will make a play for your living room during I/O. Sony plans to put Android TV in all its 2015 models, and developers are now encouraged to create Android TV and Cast-enabled apps.</p> <p>They recently announced Nexus Player, too and struck gold with Chromecast, the dirt cheap dongle. Chromecast looks to be a big focus for Google at this year's IO, with several sessions dedicated to the music and video streaming platform. Google is reportedly already working on Chromecast 2, making an IO reveal likely. Gaming via Android TV and the smart home also look to be important parts of Google's I/O plans.</p> <p><b>Android Wear</b><br/>One session is called: “Badass and beautiful. Tech and human. Love and work”. The blurb... “Debuting \"wearables we hope will blow your socks off. Our goal: break the tension between the ever-shrinking screen sizes necessary to make electronics wearable and our ability to have rich interactions with them - Why can't you have both? We like to build new things. Sometimes seemingly impossible things. We can build them faster together.\"</p> <p>What could these be? Holograph-projecting smartwatches? A re-imagined Google Glass? A modular smartwatch? A device we haven't imagined yet? A Google watch has been the stuff of legend for some time. Google has a stranglehold on the smartwatch market with Android Wear, the wearable OS has taken hold surprisingly quickly. For Google to truly be in the wearable conversation, however, we need to see its own branded hardware as the hallmark for what Android Wear can really do. Something we can point to and say, \"Hey, see what Google came up with?\" Something to complete the look with our Nexus phone, Nexus tablet and Google Glass. Let’s see if it turns up.</p> <p><b>Glass 2</b><br/>Google has two choices - try to re-capture the public's imagination with Glass or let Glass slide quietly out of sight. We expect Google to place lots of emphasis on apps for Glass, plus show us hardware that's vastly improved and/or vastly cheaper.<br/>Google Glass 2 is being designed by Italian eyewear maker Luxottica, which could make the wearable look like a very fancy pair of glasses and not a normal set at all. Luxottica CEO Massimo Vian, said his company has partnered with Google to make the next version of Glass. \"In Google, there are some second thoughts on how to interpret version 3 [of the eyewear],\" Vian said during a meeting in Milan. \"What you saw was version 1. We're now working on version 2, which is in preparation.\" Wait, there's a third version, too? It seems Google and Luxottica are very busy indeed.</p> <p><b>Internet Of Things</b><br/>Google paid a lot for Nest and Tony Fadell (the man who led the team for the first iterations of iPod and iPhone). Expect something big in this space – Google doesn’t just want your living room – they want the whole house (and street).</p> <p><b>Browsers and Operating Systems</b><br/>Chrome also seems likely for lots of I/O love. While we haven't heard anything specific to IO, we do have a sense of things to come. Google announced in mid-January Chrome Remote Desktop for iOS, letting users access their PC on their iPhone or iPad. The concept is nothing new, but the fact Google released this specifically for iOS gives us a clue that more cross-OS functionality is top of Google's mind.</p> <p><b>ARA – the Modular Mobile</b><br/>The intrigue around Project Ara, Google's modular phone, is palpable. So many options for parts, we're in for some Project Ara discussion during a Day 2 session focused on Google's Advanced Technology and Projects team (ATAP), featuring ATAP head Regina Dugan.</p> <p><b>Tango – putting some fizz back into Tablets</b><br/>Project Tango, Google's tablet that combines VR, AR and 3D mapping into one, has a dedicated session at IO. Almost a year since Project Tango was unveiled, now it's time for developers to learn how to create location-aware and spatial experiences and a \"sneak peak at how Project Tango will help users connect the virtual world with the real world.\" Sounds fun.</p> <p><b>VR - Cardboard or not</b><br/>Recently announcing choice updates for its VR viewer, Google Cardboard , including a dedicated page for apps on Google Play and places to purchase Cardboard so users don't have to make their own, Developers got access to Cardboard SDKs for Android and Unity. <br/>Google has several sessions dealing with VR during I/O. One is called \"Make Believe\" and developers will \"explore virtual reality and how it may change our lives\" - how VR works and how to create VR experiences. The session description never mentions Google Cardboard by name, so perhaps Google is changing the name or showcasing a new device entirely? Whether this means Google delivers a more durable headset, reveals apps and games developed for Cardboard as-is, or introduces virtual reality features somehow tied to Glass, we don't know, but the VR market is too hot for Google to pass up - Google is hiring for positions in Cardboard and VR - this is not the last we've heard about the DIY VR viewer.</p> <p><b>Android Auto</b><br/>Besides wearables, there's really no hotter space for companies to get into than cars . Google, as you know, has been very active, showing off its self-driving car with no steering wheel, its low accident record and plans to put functioning vehicles on Northern California roads this year. A Google IO 2015 demo is plausible. Meanwhile, car companies are signing up for Android Auto with launches from Pioneer, Volkswagen and Parrot at CES. Google has car talk planned with two Android Auto sessions planned for I/O, focusing on helping developers create apps for the road. </p> <p><b>Pull out your Google Wallet</b><br/>Apple has gone serious about mobile payments with Apple Pay, and Google bought Softcard to corral some big names into its tap-to-pay service circle. Google Wallet will get some love during I/O. Google can't sit idly by as its rival gobbles up NFC payment-dom.</p> <p><b>Focus on your Fit</b><br/>Google Fit launched as a Google Play app last October, while developers were given full access to the platform's APIs. As developers create health-enhancing programs for Android users and devices become better equipped to use Google Fit's feature set, there should be plenty to relay. Just how far has Fit come and what does the future hold for Google and health. Google may have a fitness tracking wearable to show that puts Fit front and center and they’ll probably back it with announcements on Genomes and big data in health.</p> <p>What else might we see? With Microsoft launching hololens and Apple holding a Developer Conference next month, there's a lot to do to stay ahead. Expect some surprises.</p> ","how_to_find_us":"That's hard.

This failure gravitated me towards a brand strategy consultancy where I spent a year as a sponge. A pink sponge. That experience challenged the way I looked at the world. It made me see &amp; look at businesses differently - cutting through the noise of disruption &amp; innovation.

We're living in a world where services at Google are being externalized as products so you can build on them to go fast without first spending 10 years and £10 Billion building it. We'll be covering Google Cloud Platform (GCP) in general but specifically Kubernetes, Spanner, Tensorflow and Apache Beam. All technologies that are making huge impacts on the way people run services, process data and train models for prediction.</p> <p><b><i>ML Highlights from GCP Next :</i></b></p> <p>A number of the organisers attended the GCP NEXT conference in San Francisco and will talk about some of the hot topics from GCP Next over the coming events. </p> <p>Following on Gus's theme Perusha Moodley will give an overview of some highlights from Next including \"Reimagining human computer interaction with Cloud Speech API\" and \"Extending the Google Assistant with Actions on Google\"</p> <p>Learn how Cloud Speech API enables developers to build a new genre of applications. Cloud Speech API enables users to interact with your mobile and IoT applications in a whole new way. In addition, it enables new opportunities for generating insights from existing audio sources (e.g., phone calls or videos).  </p> <p>Also learn how to create a simple action from scratch using API.ai and Google Assistant. </p> <p><b>Speaker Bios</b></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/gustavmaskowitz/\">Gustav Maskowitz</a> is a Google Cloud Solutions Engineer. </p> <p>\"Google Cloud Platform is amazing and I get to give startups $100K free cloud hosting and help solve their problems. Best job in the world.</p> <p>In related news, BigQuery, Dataflow and BigTable are tools unlike anything you've ever experienced. Try it! Google has solved the data problem.</p> <p>About me: I love helping people. I love solving problems and lateral thinking. Enjoy studying languages, psychology, philosophy and history.

Whereas traditional classifiers typically use several iterations over the same data this is not possible on data streams, as they are potentially very fast and infinite. Hence algorithms that only need one pass through the data are required.</p> <p>This is an overview about a novel algorithm for classification for approaches in dealing with data in real-time streaming environment.</p> <p><i><b>Multi-task learning for recommendations systems in tensorflow and keras</b></i></p> <p><b>Speaker:</b> <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/giovanni-vacanti-289906102/\">Giovanni Vacanti</a>, Machine Learning Engineer @ <a href=\"https://www.seldon.io\">Seldon</a></p> <p>Giovanni is a theoretical quantum physicist and data science expert with eight years experience in academic research.

With the adoption of microservices, observability and reliability is becoming more important.</p> <p>During this workshop, we build a microservices enabled application on top of Kubernetes and demonstrate Istio as an effective tool for managing some of the operational complexity. We demonstrate reliability patterns such as rate limiting, circuit breakers, and even hack into our application to show the security layers that Istio provides.</p> <p>Profile<br/>------------<br/>Nick Joyce is a partner at Real Kinetic where he helps companies build scalable systems and organisations. Previously, he was the Head of Infrastructure Engineering at Workiva where he designed and built the CI/CD pipeline and PaaS used to run the second generation of applications. He is passionate about all things 'DevOps' and making it as simple as possible for developers to get quality code in front of customers as fast as possible.</p> <p>Nick has been working with the cloud for the past 10 years and is an advocate for cloud native technologies like containers and Kubernetes. Recently, as microservices are becoming more prevalent, his focus has been around observability and reliability and has spent a lot of time with Istio, a service mesh that connects, manages, and secures microservices.</p> ","how_to_find_us":"Parking is available on site.

Ilya will share with you what it means, and how easy it is to create cloud native applications, CICD pipelines, integrate operations and more, using GitOps. Inherited from best practices going back 10-15 years, cloud native is making these practices more relevant today. At Weaveworks, their experiences are based on operating a full CNCF stack in anger for more than two years. This includes continuously updated Kubernetes, Prometheus, Fluentd, OpenTracing, and more.

A Google Developer Expert and the author of O’Reilly’s “High Performance Android Apps,” Doug has spoken at developer conferences in the US and Europe, and blogs regularly at dougsillars.com. He is currently working as a freelance digital nomad, traveling with his family in Europe.</p> <p>Synopsis<br/>------------<br/>Fast and Beautiful Images and Video...</p> <p>The average website page weight is 50% images and 25% video. As the images and videos delivered to mobile devices get larger and larger, the load time of websites gets slower and slower. Further complicating matters, there are thousands of screens and devices with varying resolutions and CPU power that receive this content. In this talk, we’ll examine strategies to send the perfect image or video to every device, ensuring a fast, beautiful rendering of your content. We’ll look at how to test our content, and describe responsive images, delivering progressive images, and finally optimising all of this content for fast delivery to each screen. Attendees will walk away with a better understanding of how to efficiently deliver beautiful images to every device that accesses their content.</p> <p>Applied Image Optimisations Workshop.</p> <p>This will require a laptop and provided wifi. It'll run on any browser - and can be hosted on Github (or anywhere really). We'll apply the optimisations we covered in the talk to an actual website that is really slow.</p> ","how_to_find_us":"Parking is available on site.

After starting his adulthood in a media agency, he quickly left to experience startup world to teach them agile and DevOps thinking. Right now he is climbing some rocks, playing with containers, scaling clouds and teaching things to both startups and multinational corporations.</p> <p>1. Deploying Kubernetes to cloud environments<br/>Kubernetes is rising in traction and replaces all sorts of deployment practices in the market. But in order for your developers to get started using it, a running cluster would be step zero for them and step one for you as an operator.</p> <p>In this introduction we will go through some cloud vendors like Google Cloud and AWS and talk about different ways to deploy Kubernetes in those environments. We will talk about Google Kubernetes Service (GKE), Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), kubeadm and kops to name a few of the tools we will look into.</p> <p>2. Unboxing and boxing container images<br/>Everyone wants to use containers today yet most don't really know how they function and what is in the box. Also building containers in unprivileged contexts can be challenging. In this talk we will look into a docker image and discuss how to create those packages using tools like kaniko ---- For most people that want to create a docker image the journey ends with docker build. What this will trigger is building a docker image using the running docker engine on your host. The problems start at a point where you don't have access to the docker daemon, want to build a container in a container (as most CI systems execute in containers nowadays) or just have limited permissions on the system. For this we will open the mystical box of a docker image by looking into: - Layers - Empty Layers - Configuration Details. Then we will look into the kaniko project that tries to build those images without ever touching a docker daemon to better understand how those images can be created and how to work in more restricted environments. Those information can also be very helpful when looking into container security and scanning what is in the box.</p> ","how_to_find_us":"Central Working has kindly offered to host us for the evening.

These models allow approximate samples from a complex high-dimensional target distribution, using a model distribution, where estimation of likelihoods and exact inference are not tractable. GANs have yielded very impressive empirical results, particularly for image generation, far beyond the quality of samples seen from most earlier generative models. These excellent results, however, have depended on adding a variety of methods of regularization and other tricks to stabilize the notoriously difficult optimization problem of GANs. Still, the reason why these additional tricks are needed is not completely understood. In the present work we shade some light on the reasons such instabilities occur and provide a principled method for regularization when the Maximum Mean Discrepancy is used as a loss. Experimental results show that the proposed regularization leads to stable training and outperforms state-of-the art methods on image generation.</p> <p>Speaker Bio:<br/>Michael Arbel<br/>Michael is a Ph.D. student at the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit under the the supervision of Arthur Gretton.

Despite this, users just aren't used to treating websites like normal applications on their phone so more often than not they turn to the App Store or the Google Play Store.</p> <p>Wouldn't it be great if there were a way that you could make a real native application for Android and iOS (maybe more?) without having to deal with, the \"should I learn Swift or Objective C\" or \"do I really have to write Java\" debates.</p> <p>Enter React Native, an open source framework for building native applications in JavaScript/React, created by Facebook.</p> <p>In this session I'm going to introduce you to React Native, show you why it's a bit more special than some other similar technologies you may also have heard of. After some slides I'll show some cool examples and talk through the code so by the end of it you can come away with an understanding of why React Native is becoming such a sought after skill for developers (especially within start up culture). How it can possibly work, and how you can start creating awesome applications that you can publish on the App Store and Google Play Store.</p> <p>Bio: Joe is a final year student at the University of Reading studying Computer Science. He has worked with React Native for 2 years and has taken an app from start to publication to help students find people to live with. Joe has experience with GraphQL, NodeJS and a cornucopia of front end tools.

You're not alone! This will be a safe space where you can admit that you don't think writing something on a post-it note makes it any more innovative. Designing an application is a relatively new challenge and the processes we use to solve our problems have evolved like crazy. Some have genuinely changed the world and other may have even ruined it. This session will introduce you to these processes and their outcomes, to the people who found new ways of working and the current struggles we still have today. The goal is to give you a curiosity to find out more about using design process to solve problems in your life or work and to give you a vocabulary to communicate design better with others.</p> <p>Rob Sutcliffe<br/>Rob is a designer and front-end developer with over 10 years experience. Over those years he has worked in startups, multinationals, managed design teams and consulted fortune 500 companies. He got his degree in Graphical Communications from The University College of The Creative Arts. And more recently Rob has started writing about and teaching design skills. He believes that it's best to be exposed to a range of environments and people to improve his craft. In fact the only thing in common in each of the places he has worked is... no one seemed to know what they were saying, when they said \"UX\"!</p> <p>Agenda:</p> <p>18:30 Food and networking<br/>19:00 - 19:55 : Joe Fazzino - Building true native mobile applications with JavaScript<br/>20:00 - 21:00 : Rob Sutcliffe - Confused About User Experience Design?</p> ","how_to_find_us":"https://www.spacesworks.com/reading/greyfriars-road/","visibility":"public"},{"created":1548378044000,"duration":9000000,"id":"258373119","name":"[WebDev]  What is Kotlin and why should you use it.

It is all too common to see code bases littered with meaningless variables loaded onto framework properties, long winding functions that serve multiple purposes and badly named files. Using techniques from `The Clean Architecture (TCA): A Craftsman's Guide to Software Structure and Design by Robert (Uncle Bob) Martin, Matt will show steps that any developer can start taking to break their code into multiple files with more clearly defined roles. By using this common architectural framework for building apps developers will leverage greater flexibility and less brittleness.</p> <p>*Pete (Becoming a Software Professional)* : This talk is about the most important things Pete has learned about being a software professional. From his days as a frustrated employee developer fed up working with spaghetti code to setting up a business and working out what it would take to hire and bring out the best in a team of developers who want to deliver the cleanest of code with the minimum of fuss. As an added bonus Pete will also introduce his thoughts on gaining better focus and more energy and using physiological techniques.</p> <p>*Bios*<br/>Matt: Matt is a software developer who moved from an enterprise team to work with Logic Room in 2018. He is interested in writing scalable JavaScript and TypeScript architecture which allows easier comprehension and modification for Logic Rooms client full stack apps. He is an advanced practitioner of Logic Rooms methodologies; The Clean Architecture (TCA) for JavaScript and Test Driven Development Simplified (TDDS).</p> <p>Pete: Pete is the founder of Logic Room who has a deep interest in ensuring Logic Rooms client apps can change as fast as their clients business does. He helps the team at Logic Room make space to be able to work to the highest levels of professionalism, ensuring both process and methodology can work in unison to deliver results.</p> <p>*About Logic Room*<br/>Logic Room is a JavaScript and TypeScript Software consultancy that helps companies build scalable, stable and testable apps. They work as a company’s team or as an extension of their team. They provide development services, consultancy and strategic technology advice for teams. The frameworks they know and love are Node, React, Angular and React Native.</p> <p>Agenda:<br/>18:30 Food and networking<br/>19:00 - 20:00 : Pete (Becoming a Software Professional)<br/>20:00 - 21:00
