However, this simplicity is often misleading as Gradle scripts have the potential for more intricate behaviors than XML property file build systems. The complexity gap between the simple and the possible often causes roadblocks when an Android developer needs to do anything unique during a build. In this talk, you will learn how to bridge that gap by diving under the hood to explore how simple and complicated build scripts work. You will learn when and where lines of your build scripts are executed and what conditions prevent them from changing the state of your build. You will also learn how you can create reusable code in a multi-app build environment, and how to solve build process development challenges by using advanced tools and techniques. Finally, you will hear important tips to make sure your Android Gradle scripts work well within the plugin ecosystem. All these lessons come from the instructor's experiences developing the Crashlytics plugin for Gradle, which has been used in production by top Android app developers for the past year. This talk will cover advanced Gradle topics, but make them accessible to newer users.</p> <p><b>Schedule:</b></p> <p>05:30pm: Registration Opens/ Doors Open<br/>06:15pm: Registration Closes<br/>05:30pm - 06:30pm: Food, Drinks, &amp; Networking<br/>06:30pm - 07:45pm: Talk<br/>07:45pm - 08:30pm: Networking<br/>08:30pm: Doors Close</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1416781098000,"id":"218860641","name":"AndevCon Recap: Wearables","rsvp_limit":20,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1416954600000,"local_date":"2014-11-25","local_time":"17:30","rsvp_open_offset":"PT15M","updated":1416966002000,"utc_offset":-18000000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":1,"venue":{"id":22032652,"name":"Staples Velocity Lab","lat":42.365665435791016,"lon":-71.0902099609375,"repinned":false,"address_1":"One Kendall Square","city":"Cambridge","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"","state":"MA"},"group":{"created":1285969377000,"name":"GDG Boston Android","id":1715787,"join_mode":"open","lat":42.36000061035156,"lon":-71.06999969482422,"urlname":"boston-android","who":"Members","localized_location":"Boston, MA","state":"MA","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Eastern"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/boston-android/events/218860641/","description":"<p>See and register at  <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/wearables-and-e-textiles/events/218707331/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.meetup.com/wearables-and-e-textiles/events/218707331/</a></p> <p>We will go over all we learned at the AnDevCon San Franscisco.</p> <p>BYOF.</p> <p>Panel: </p> <p>Burc Oral</p> <p>Ilya Tsambal</p> ","how_to_find_us":"Across Kendall Square Movie Theater on Binney St.","visibility":"public"},{"created":1417448838000,"id":"218998574","name":"Android Wear Code Lab - Prep for January Wear Hackathon","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1418484600000,"local_date":"2014-12-13","local_time":"10:30","updated":1418527186000,"utc_offset":-18000000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":20,"venue":{"id":20194632,"name":"Google","lat":42.362945556640625,"lon":-71.08660888671875,"repinned":false,"address_1":"4 Cambridge Center","city":"Cambridge","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"","state":"MA"},"group":{"created":1285969377000,"name":"GDG Boston Android","id":1715787,"join_mode":"open","lat":42.36000061035156,"lon":-71.06999969482422,"urlname":"boston-android","who":"Members","localized_location":"Boston, MA","state":"MA","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Eastern"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/boston-android/events/218998574/","manual_attendance_count":39,"description":"<p><b>Please register for the code lab here: <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/gdg-boston/events/218910056/\"><a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/gdg-boston/events/218910056/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.meetup.com/gdg-boston/events/218910056/</a></a></b></p> <p>Co-sponsored Google Developer Group and Boston Android<br/>Location: Google, 4 Cambridge Center<br/>Date: Saturday December 13<br/>Doors Open: 10:30AM<br/>Lunch and snacks served </p> <p><b>Update 12/9: </b>A  Googler or two working with Android Wear will join us for this event.</p> <p><b>Update 12/9: </b>Samsung has joined as a sponsor and provide up to 3 Note 4's and Gear S watches as prizes for the 1/10/2015 hackathon.</p> <p>Hi Folks,</p> <p>We're having an Android Wear Code Lab on Sat Dec 13 in preparation for a Wear Hackathon.We'll have one or two Google Wear engineers teaching assistants to help to at the code lab.</p> <p>Tne Android Wear Hackathon will take place on Sat Jan[masked] sponsored by Google, Motorola and Samsung and possibley other smarthwatch and wearable companies.

For those completely new to Java we are looking to start up a virtual study group in Java, so keep an eye out for that, coming soon. We are also looking for mentors in Java for when we meet in person. We also started a Slack Channel, it's called AndroidBoston which we encourage you to join.  </p> <p>Call for speakers, we are opening up the floor for brief talks at the beginning of the event, if there is interest. Very impromptu, and casual no slides needed, yet going over code is encouraged. We will have a separate breakout session for this, and each be given 5-15 minutes to present. We are looking for no more than three speakers on the following:</p> <p>-Learning Java 101, what are the core building blocks to Java that everyone should know, what are some the pains to learning Java, and how did you overcome them?</p> <p>-Product Design for Android: Have you published an app in the Google play store, what was your recipe to making an app that everyone loves?  </p> <p>-Android Developer Summit recap, what were your key takeaways, and how will this change Android in 2016?</p> <p>If you're interested in mentoring for our upcoming Java virtual study, want an invite to our slack channel, or itching to do a talk. Here is your chance! You can send me a direct message if you are interested.  </p> <p>Don't forget to follow us <a href=\"https://twitter.com/androidboston\">@AndroidBoston</a></p> <p><b>Special thanks to our host and sponsor for our next HackNight, Intrepid Pursuits..</b></p> <p><img src=\"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/2/4/4/600_446001060.jpeg\" /></p> <p>Intrepid is an end-to-end mobile design and development company with offices in Cambridge, MA and NYC.

You\u2019ll learn about Object Oriented Programming, a technique that allows you to use code written by other programmers in your own programs. You\u2019ll put your new Java programming skills to the test by solving real-world problems faced by software engineers.</p> <p><b><br/>Why Take This Course? </b> <br/>Java is one of the most popular programming languages used by software developers today. It is the core language used in developing Android apps, and is also commonly used in back-end web development. If you\u2019re new to programming and want to enter either of these fields, this course is a great place to get started.</p> <p>Even if you don\u2019t have a career trajectory in mind, Java programming is a great option for first-time coders due to its popularity and ease of use. This course will provide you with a solid foundation in computer science and Object Oriented Programming concepts, as well as set you on the path for success as a software engineer.</p> <p><b><br/>Prerequisites and Requirements<br/></b>No prior programming experience and knowledge is assumed or needed.

Those interested in taking their Android development skills to the next level should join us. People interested in taking the course must come to this meeting to register. What will you learn?<br/>We\u2019ll use the free version of the Udacity Advanced Android App Development course (<a href=\"https://www.udacity.com/courses/ud855\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.udacity.com/courses/ud855</a>) as a framework and meet one night a week for about 8 weeks for a study session led by experienced developers.</p> <p>This course teaches you how to productionize an app and get it ready for the Google Play Store. In the process, new tools and concepts will be introduced, including: material design approaches, image-handling, cloud messaging, and performance profiling. This class will give you what it takes to ship polished apps as part of a development team at a company. It\u2019s a 6 hour per week time commitment.</p> <p>Why a study group? Less than 12% of the people who start an online course by themselves finish it. We\u2019ve seen over 50% of the people who signed up for an online course who were committed to a study group complete the course. And, the developers who complete the course will receive a Google Developer Group Certificate of Completion.</p> <p>Here\u2019s what to expect:</p> <p>We\u2019ll all meet for the first time at the Signup Evening on, Thursday February[masked] at 6:30PM at Raizlabs, 50 Milk Street, 19th floor, Boston MA 02109. We\u2019ll review the course, what\u2019s expected of you, and how these study groups have been run in the past. Fully informed and with your questions answered, you can then choose to sign up.</p> <p>Following the Signup Evening, each week one lesson from the Udacity course will be completed prior to the study group meeting. An experienced study group lead will present an overview of the lesson followed by Q&amp;A and class discussion. Each study group session will last one and a half to two hours. Some food will be served so you don\u2019t have to stop on your way from work.</p> <p>Who should attend?</p> <p>This course builds on Java programming and Android skills you already have. To get the most out of this course, you should have at least 1-2 years of Java experience, and prior experience developing Android apps.</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1450136718000,"id":"bhxwmlyvdbmc","name":"Informal Android Developer Meetup (Boston Edition)","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1456790400000,"local_date":"2016-02-29","local_time":"19:00","updated":1456802774000,"utc_offset":-18000000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":8,"venue":{"id":24112236,"name":"Jaho Coffee Roasters & Wine Bar","lat":42.35176086425781,"lon":-71.0630111694336,"repinned":false,"address_1":"665 Washington Street","city":"Boston","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"","state":"MA"},"group":{"created":1285969377000,"name":"GDG Boston Android","id":1715787,"join_mode":"open","lat":42.36000061035156,"lon":-71.06999969482422,"urlname":"boston-android","who":"Members","localized_location":"Boston, MA","state":"MA","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Eastern"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/boston-android/events/bhxwmlyvdbmc/","description":"<p>Android developers get together for informal discussion of mobile technologies.

We will be meeting on the first floor in the cafe, right off the entrance, but people will need to check in with security.</b></p> <p>We'll meet every Wednesday to learn together for the next 9 or 10 weeks to learn Android using the Udacity Android Fundamentals free course. Zipcar has generously agreed to sponsor the venue and refreshments for this free community produced course.</p> <p>This hands on course will cover wide ranging topics that will help you build complex apps with compelling layouts. It's taught using the Android Studio IDE. Please check the minimum system requirements to see if your machine matches. Why a study group? Less than 12% of the people who start an online course by themselves finish it. We\u2019ve seen over 50% of the people who signed up for an online course who were committed to a study group complete the course. And, the developers who complete the course will receive a Google Developer Group Certificate of Completion.</p> <p>Here\u2019s what to expect:</p> <p>At the Signup evening on Weds May 11 at Zipcar we'll introduce the Study Jam. We\u2019ll review the course syllabus, what\u2019s expected of you and what you need to do to succeed.Registration will open at the end of the meeting. Beginning on Wednesday evening May 25th and continuing for about 8 weeks we will meet at Zipcar to review our work together as a group. These weekly sessions will be led by experienced Android developers. The format will begin with a review followed by Q&amp;A and student's discussions about their work. Each study group session will last one and a half to two hours. Some food will be served so you don\u2019t have to stop on your way from work.</p> <p>It will be great to see you there.</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1451948508000,"duration":10800000,"id":"xxzknlyvhbvb","name":"Monthly HackNight #ABHN42","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1463328000000,"local_date":"2016-05-15","local_time":"12:00","updated":1463340822000,"utc_offset":-14400000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":7,"venue":{"id":24041050,"name":"Forge Baking Company","lat":42.384063720703125,"lon":-71.11039733886719,"repinned":false,"address_1":"626 Somerville Ave 02143","city":"Somerville","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"","state":"MA"},"group":{"created":1285969377000,"name":"GDG Boston Android","id":1715787,"join_mode":"open","lat":42.36000061035156,"lon":-71.06999969482422,"urlname":"boston-android","who":"Members","localized_location":"Boston, MA","state":"MA","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Eastern"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/boston-android/events/xxzknlyvhbvb/","description":"<p><img src=\"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/b/b/600_441781723.jpeg\" /></p> <p>Bring any Android project you like, weather you are currently working on a side project as a hobby, have a new startup idea you want to work on, or just getting started on some tuts, and interested in learning more about Android in general!

The benefits are substantial.This talk describes concepts and benefits behind Dependency Injection pattern. It shows step-by-step converting imperative dependency resolution to dependency injection using Dagger 2. </p> <p>This is an intermediate session with lots of code shown, along with diagrams and explanations.Benefits of Dependency Injection discussed in detail and demonstrated: Inversion of Control; Testability; Lifecyce of dependencies.</p> <p>Large section of presentation will demonstrate injecting dependencies in a test environment. Both production code and test code will be demonstrated. Other topics will include mocking / stubbing, use of Mock webserver and JSON parsing.</p> <p>This talk is based on a implementation of Dagger 2 in a production project. Many lessons learned and wealth of experience gained.Speaker </p> <p><b>Ilya Tsymbal</b> is an independent Android developer, currently working at LevelUp payment company. Mr. Tsymbal has over 20 years of Java development experience, including experience with other Dependency Injection frameworks.I lya has been an instructor for Android Developer course based on Udacity's 'Developing Android Apps' course, hosted by Boston's Google Developer Group.

This is focused on the theoretical insights behind the ideas in the \"Deep Learning with Tensorflow\" workshop, but it won't be necessary to understand it all to benefit from the workshop.</p> <p>10:45 AM fastText Tutorial</p> <p>              Edouard Grave Ph.D. </p> <p><a href=\"https://code.facebook.com/posts/162370720961195/expanded-fasttext-library-now-fits-on-smaller-memory-devices/\">fastText</a> is an open source text classification library created by the Facebook Artificial Intelligence team.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText/commit/f5f3ecd9b00cc84311a958da2b52e32fba6a491c\">tutorial </a>begins with with supervised text classification and steps through the tutorial giving the developer experience building a simple text classifier on a custom dataset. Then the tutorial leads the developer through tuning the model for the best performance. The tutorial then isis used to learn word representations from Wikipedia pages. The tutorial steps through simple ways to test the quality of a model. Queries return a word\u2019s nearest neighbors or given a related pair example, analogies produce the most closely related words to a queried word including mispelled words and made-up words. </p> <p>fastText is notable because it runs on any device, small memory devices like raspberry pis to GPU servers and it is available with pretrained vectors in 294 languages. Performance compares favorably to more complex neural network models.</p> <p>12:15 PM Lunch </p> <p>1:00 PM Introduction to Deep Learning with Tensorflow</p> <p>Alex Coventry </p> <p>From <a href=\"https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml/blob/master/11_deep_learning.ipynb\">examples</a> which everyone can test out during the lab, you\u2019ll learn how you can repurpose Google- and Facebook-trained neural nets to your own projects, and tricks for designing and training nets which generalize well to previously unseen examples. For the sake of time we will have to focus on the linked examples, but bring and ask your questions about how it all works -- The purpose of this workshop is to get you up and running, and able to apply neural nets to your own projects. </p> <p>Speakers:</p> <p>Steven Max Patterson</p> <p>Steven is a project manager and journalist for IDG, as well as a contributor for Ars Technica and Fast Company. He co-organizes the Google Developer Group in Boston that informs the Boston developer community of new technologies, delivers skill-based learning, and provides a forum for developers to inform one another. </p> <p>Edouard Grave Ph.D.</p> <p>Edouard is postdoctoral researcher at Facebook AI Research, working on machine learning and natural language processing. Before joining Facebook, he was a postdoctoral research scientist at Columbia University and UC Berkeley. He obtained his Ph.D. in computer science from Université Paris VI in 2014, working under the supervision of Francis Bach and Guillaume Obozinski.</p> <p>Alex Coventry Ph.D.</p> <p>Alex is researching stochastic optimization methods, similar to the reparameterization trick often used in Deep Learning. He runs the Cambridge AI meetup with Paul Miller, a group which <a href=\"https://github.com/pmiller10/cambridge-ai#schedule\">meets weekly to discuss recent neural net developments</a> and their implementations. He has a Ph.D. in Applied Math from MIT.</p> <p>AI for Software Engineers is organized by Cambridge AI, the Google Developer Group and Mobile Tea. </p> <p>The day is sponsored by Akamai, Google and Facebook. </p> <p>Note: Because our events are free some people register and do not attend, so we allow more people to register than we have seating room. Based on the success of past events, we have had on occassion more people arrive that we have seating and at some point we will have to limit the number of people admitted to comply with fire codes.

It's been a while since we last met but we'd like to kick off this years programming with a talk on Gradle. We'll also be raffling off a Droidcon Ticket and some Droidcon Beanies as well. On top of that we have a JetBrains license to raffle as well. If you don't win the ticket no worries, we will also have a 20% discount code that we'll give out at the meetup. Light refreshments and snacks will be served. \u2022 What we'll do<br/>Bio: Clive is an Android developer at Ovia Health. He complains about gradle scripts all the time, but deep down inside he secretly enjoys working on them.</p> <p>Abstract:<br/>Close your eyes. Imagine your gradle files. Are there countless amounts of copy &amp; pasted lines? Every time you update a version of a dependency, do you have to change several different files? Did you change all the 'compile's to 'api's and called it a day? As your project keeps growing, as more and more modules are added, does your build time seem to increase exponentially? You've seen some of the gradle files in sample projects, marveled at their pristine, geometric beauty, and muttered, \"Maybe someday, on a greenfield far, far away...\" The gap between that ideal and reality seems far, far apart.<br/>Now open your eyes. There is a more pragmatic approach to cleaning your gradle files. They don't have to be perfect, and the cleaning process can be iterative. In this talk, Clive will go over some of the practical steps you can take to organize your gradle files, bit by bit.</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1501523139000,"id":"fqlqnnyxfbqb","name":"Informal Android Developer Meetup (Boston Edition)","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1520895600000,"local_date":"2018-03-12","local_time":"19:00","updated":1520910991000,"utc_offset":-14400000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":18,"venue":{"id":24112236,"name":"Jaho Coffee Roasters & Wine Bar","lat":42.35176086425781,"lon":-71.0630111694336,"repinned":false,"address_1":"665 Washington Street","city":"Boston","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"","state":"MA"},"group":{"created":1285969377000,"name":"GDG Boston Android","id":1715787,"join_mode":"open","lat":42.36000061035156,"lon":-71.06999969482422,"urlname":"boston-android","who":"Members","localized_location":"Boston, MA","state":"MA","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Eastern"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/boston-android/events/fqlqnnyxfbqb/","description":"<p>Android developers get together for informal discussion of mobile technologies.

Every vertical market has the need for video apps. So, you want to learn how to build a video streaming app, but you don\u2019t know where to get started or you are not a video expert? Or maybe you are just curious about video technology? Then, this session is for you!</p> <p>To build a live-streaming app for Android, you don\u2019t have to be a video expert. Using a mobile SDK and cloud streaming service can help you quickly and easily integrate live video into an existing app or service or build a livestream app from the ground up. Using these tools, you can build anything from a basic one-way broadcasting platform to a fully interactive live-streaming app that allows users to create and share their own videos. This is referred to as user generated content. It\u2019s all about the tools, huh?</p> <p>What about the need for speed? More and more apps demand real-time streaming delivery\u2014such as those for gaming, financial trading, auctions or interactive experiences like HQ Trivia\u2014you need an API that\u2019s built for speed.

Here's a chance to hang out in the super cool NERD Center, eat pizza and network with other mobile technologists.</p> <p>Xamarin.Forms: Cross-platform app development for Android and iOS</p> <p>Java and Kotlin are elegant and powerful languages, but what if you're asked to \"do an iOS version\"? Now you dive into the Apple docs on Objective-C, and you're stuck with two apps, doing everything twice. Forever and ever...</p> <p>Why not use cross-platform development tools. Leverage Xamarin.Forms to build iOS and Android apps creating a single code base with a cross-platform approach. Using Microsoft Visual Studio, C#, and XAML, you can get up to 99% code reuse! Code first for Android, make a few tweaks for iOS, and the maintenance on both platforms is a breeze!</p> <p>Join Dan Hermes President, Microsoft Regional Director (RD) and Xamarin MVP for Lexicon Systems to celebrate the release of his second Apress book on mobile development, \"Building Xamarin Forms Mobile Apps Using XAML.\" Dan is joined onstage by the Microsoft Program Manager for the Xamarin.Forms Developer experience, Maddy Leger. These talks are about cross-platform development for iOS and Android, and how you can use your Android skills with Xamarin.Forms.</p> <p>Here's your ticket into the NERD Center for some mobile technologist fun. Get comfortable at the Microsoft venue with your very own GDG Boston Android group. Learn Microsoft technologies for mobile development. There are 2 talks and plenty of time for networking. It will be new and different, a night to remember.</p> ","how_to_find_us":"The meeting room is Horace Mann ( 1st floor conference center )","visibility":"public"},{"created":1545144640000,"duration":10800000,"id":"dbdqrqyzfbpb","name":"Informal Android Developer Meetup (Boston Edition)","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1552345200000,"local_date":"2019-03-11","local_time":"19:00","updated":1552361564000,"utc_offset":-14400000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":14,"venue":{"id":26019567,"name":"Jaho Back Bay Coffee Roaster & Wine Bar ","lat":42.34651565551758,"lon":-71.07978820800781,"repinned":true,"address_1":"116 Huntington Ave ","city":"Boston","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"02116","state":"ma"},"group":{"created":1285969377000,"name":"GDG Boston Android","id":1715787,"join_mode":"open","lat":42.36000061035156,"lon":-71.06999969482422,"urlname":"boston-android","who":"Members","localized_location":"Boston, MA","state":"MA","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Eastern"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/boston-android/events/dbdqrqyzfbpb/","description":"<p>Android developers get together for informal discussion of mobile technologies.
