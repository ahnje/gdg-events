And we are happy that Alexander Thiel, CTO of StyleLounge is taking the lead for the first round. Looking forward to see you there!</p> <p><b>Topic Summary:</b></p> <p>A centralized data base and various services writing to it: What sometimes makes sense quickly becomes a bottle neck with growing traffic and functionality. Almost all scaling problems are caused by shared data access and its synchronization. For years focus has therefore shifted from vertical to horizontal performance. The time it takes a single function to complete is less relevant than the question whether it can be run concurrently. And that - in most applications - directly depends on how data is stored and accessed.</p> <p>In this talk I describe a simple migration strategy from monolith to reactive micro services. In addition I give references and insights their theoretical background.</p> <p><b>Bio:</b></p> <p>Since his childhood and his first steps in programming he's fascinated by coding and its virtually infinite possibilities. He worked in various startups, learning about all their specific scalability and architecture issues. Since 2015 Alexander manages the great engineers of StyleLounge, the soon-to-be biggest fashion price comparison. As a CTO he's responsible for making the application fast, extensible, clean and above all scalable. If he's not discussing software architecture he's searching for talents for his team or digs into new technologies to keep the current stack (node.js, kubernetes, wercker, TypeScript, Babel, react+redux, redis, BigQuery, Elasticsearch) up-to-date.</p> <p><b>Agenda:</b></p> <p>19.00: Food&amp;Drinks</p> <p>19.30: Intro - Christopher Denk</p> <p>19.40: Talk - Alexander Thiel</p> <p>20.40: Q&amp;A</p> <p>21.00: The End:)</p> <p><b><br/></b></p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1487686806000,"id":"237874038","name":"Cloud GDG - StackDriver: From Monitoring to Logging to Error Reporting","rsvp_limit":50,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1488304800000,"local_date":"2017-02-28","local_time":"19:00","updated":1512556946000,"utc_offset":3600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":40,"venue":{"id":23179582,"name":"Ubilabs","lat":53.5612907409668,"lon":9.961216926574707,"repinned":false,"address_1":"Juliusstraße 25","city":"Hamburg","country":"de","localized_country_name":"Germany"},"group":{"created":1390990631000,"name":"Google Developer Group Hamburg","id":12567242,"join_mode":"open","lat":53.54999923706055,"lon":10,"urlname":"Google-Developer-Group-Hamburg","who":"Mitglieder","localized_location":"Hamburg, Germany","state":"","country":"de","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Berlin"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/Google-Developer-Group-Hamburg/events/237874038/","manual_attendance_count":31,"description":"<p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>our first Cloud GDG meetup was great fun.

Advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence have spiked an interest in natural language processing, and building conversational interfaces no longer is a dream, but a reality every developer can use in their own applications.</p> <p>The problem of recognising spoken input has been largely solved, and the next challenge is how to build compelling user experiences that are modelled after natural human conversation.</p> <p>In this talk, I will give an introduction to the Google Assistant and how to use Actions on Google to build conversational interfaces for devices with and without screens.

One of Google Earth’s exciting new features is Voyager – a platform for stories around the globe. With Voyager, Google Earth not only takes you to your desired destination, but immerses you into a global adventure where there’s a lot to do, learn, and explore.</p> <p>For the past year, Ubilabs has been supporting Google in the designing, production and processing of this content. Coming up with unique approaches to storytelling and translating these ideas to Voyager’s functional and visual features has been a challenging experience.

We decided to join forces of our two existing native mobile app developer teams and use Flutter, Google’s new cross-platform framework for Android and iOS.</p> <p>Advantages like really well working hot-reload, complete code sharing for both platforms and a modern, reactive ui framework are just too good to be ignored. But Flutter is still in an early state and with that has its teething troubles and also very own shortcomings.</p> <p>In the first part of this talk I want to share the overall experience we made building our very first Flutter app and running it in production for over 3 months.</p> <p>The second half then goes full into live coding mode to show one of Flutter’s strengths: the easiness to build a fully customized animated graph, the visual highlight of our still small but beautiful app.</p> <p>After the talk you hopefully have a better picture of what Flutter is capable of, its state of maturity and which use-cases it’s already great to be taken for.\"</p> <p>The second will be held by Brian Egan, early Flutter contributor and DartConf18 speaker:</p> <p>\"BUILD A REACTIVE FLUTTER APP!</p> <p>Interested in Flutter, but love RxJava and MVI? Curious about how to structure Flutter apps? If so, join along as we explore how to architect apps using using Dart Streams! We'll cover the basics of Streams, how to beef up their power with RxDart, and how to create a Reactive Application with these patterns.</p> <p>This talk will cover the Bloc pattern introduced by Google. It's similar to MVI, and helps layer your apps, allowing you to write business logic that works flawlessly across three platforms: iOS, Android, and web.</p> <p>Come learn a bit more about Flutter and the architecture patterns that can help give your apps a testable, reusable, and cohesive structure!\"</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1536314229000,"duration":126000000,"id":"254473302","name":"DACHFest 2018 (DevFest DACH)","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1541836800000,"local_date":"2018-11-10","local_time":"09:00","updated":1541969077000,"utc_offset":3600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":1,"venue":{"id":25929047,"name":"TU Munich","lat":48.149658203125,"lon":11.56786060333252,"repinned":false,"address_1":"Arcisstraße 21 (main campus)","city":"Munich","country":"de","localized_country_name":"Germany"},"group":{"created":1390990631000,"name":"Google Developer Group Hamburg","id":12567242,"join_mode":"open","lat":53.54999923706055,"lon":10,"urlname":"Google-Developer-Group-Hamburg","who":"Mitglieder","localized_location":"Hamburg, Germany","state":"","country":"de","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Berlin"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/Google-Developer-Group-Hamburg/events/254473302/","description":"<p>For this year's DevFest season, GDG and WTM communities of Germany, Austria, and Switzerland are all working together to organize our largest event yet: DACHFest!</p> <p>DACHFest is a two-day DevFest conference focused on making a difference.
