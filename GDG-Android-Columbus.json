Prior to the spring of 2017 and Google IO I was not aware of the Kotlin language. The Kotlin Koans was the first Kotlin tutorial that I found truly valuable, <a href=\"https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/koans.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/koans.html</a>. Also, the “Kotlin in Action” book by Dmitry Jemerov and Svetlana Isakova has been extremely helpful in learning both the general concepts and the philosophy of the Kotlin language. IntelliJ IDEA has been very critical for the Journey, in that it makes setting up or opening an existing project quick. So that I can focus on learning and not the internals of the IDE. Finally the community has been very welcoming and as a new comer this is really encouraging.</p> <p>Bio: My name if Frank McAuley and I’m a tech lead for a mobile development team at Alliance Data Systems Card Division.

Some of them are more maintainable and more flexible than others. Creating good abstractions, properly decoupling your code, and creating separate layers to handle separate responsibilities are all important tools in your toolbox to when creating maintainable and flexible Android applications. Importantly, these concepts go hand-in-hand with testability. Make your app testable and you will have also made it maintainable and flexible. In this talk I'll go over how to create a maintainable and flexible app by making it testable in the first place. I'll also talk about how to make testing itself easier, which will enable you to continue to maintain the application as it grows.</p> <p>Speaker Bio:</p> <p>Jim is a software developer with more than 10 years of experience in the industry.
