Tom has been instrumental in shaping the direction and development of Hadoop and many projects in Hadoop's ecosystem. He is also the author of the book \"Hadoop: The Definitive Guide\" and a part of the team at Cloudera. Aaron Cordova is a UMD graduate working at Booz Allen Hamilton. Before joining Booz Allen Aaron played a key role in defining the critical large scale data analytics infrastructure and applications at the NSA. Currently Aaron focuses on helping government organizations manage and analyze large amounts of data using technologies such as Hadoop, Hive, and HBase. Thus enabling them to make better decisions and answer key questions important to business and operations.</p> <p>Location:<br/>Kaiser Family Foundation - Public Affairs Center<br/>1330 G St. NW<br/>Washington, DC 20005</p> <p>1 block from the Metro Center Station metro stop.</p> <p>Agenda:</p> <p>6:30 - 7:00 Food and Refreshments, Socialize<br/>7:00 - 7:30 Tom White - Hadoop's powerful parallel processing paradigm provides a great generalized framework for storing and analyzing data. For all its raw power however the practical use of Hadoop requires more. What's needed is an integrated stack of components which makes it easier to develop and use real-world applications in a production environment. Tom will discuss the evolving Hadoop platform, its components and how each fills a critical role in making Hadoop more useful in the enterprise.<br/>7:30 - 7:40 Short Break<br/>7:40 - 8:10 Aaron Cordova - One of the barriers to scaling Hadoop to 10,000 machines is the single HDFS NameNode. Recent benchmarks [1] show that the HDFS needs to be able to do an order of magnitude more writes per second to reach 10,000. The most promising way to do this is to create a distributed NameNode. Aaron will discuss the issues surrounding distributing the NameNode functionality to multiple machines, including automatically and organically partitioning the namespace, how to keep operations serialized and durable, and how recovery from failure changes.<br/>1.

PaaS systems offer programmatic access to scalable, distributed, and fault tolerant cloud services which eliminates the need for developers to write or deploy their own and enabling them to focus on their innovation.</p> <p>In this presentation, we overview a new cloud platform called<br/>AppScale. AppScale provides the benefits of PaaS but is unique in that it emulates, using open source technologies, what is arguably the \"de facto\" standard of public PaaS: Google App Engine. API-compatibilitywith App Engine means that any of the one million active App Engine apps today execute over AppScale without modification. This, in combination with the fact that AppScale executes (automatically deploys) anywhere a virtual machine can be instantiated (a laptop, an on-premise cluster, a local data center, Amazon EC2 or other IaaS), means that AppScale gives developers choice across all of the most popular deployment options available today, with no code rewrite.</p> <p>Location sponsors: <a href=\"http://www.basho.com\">Basho</a></p> ","how_to_find_us":"Google App Engine, Appscale, PaaS, Python, GO, Java, EC2, Amazon","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1366890032000,"duration":7200000,"id":"116111422","name":"Partner Event: Anticipating Google Glass","rsvp_limit":80,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1367447400000,"local_date":"2013-05-01","local_time":"18:30","rsvp_open_offset":"PT3H","updated":1367503569000,"utc_offset":-14400000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":73,"venue":{"id":12282932,"name":"1776","lat":38.90485382080078,"lon":-77.03400421142578,"repinned":false,"address_1":"1133 15TH ST.

In GXT 4.0, the core widgets have been updated to include touch functionality such as draggable borders, tree expand / collapse, LiveGrid scrolling, and long press to hover. In addition, you can add new gesture recognizers such as pinch and rotate to your apps. In this presentation, we’ll look at the ins and outs of JavaScript touch event handling for GWT developers, touch support in GXT 4.0 widgets, how to eliminate the 300ms click delay in mobile browsers, and how to work with GXT’s new gesture recognizers. In addition, we’ll discuss some of the lessons learned by the GXT team while building GXT 4.0 and demo some debugging strategies for GWT apps on touch devices.</p> <p><b>Speaker Bio:</b></p> <p>David Chandler is the Developer Advocate for GXT with <a href=\"https://www.sencha.com/\">Sencha</a>, Inc.

We'll also cover some pitfalls you might encounter while using sync services  and how to avoid them.

Apps are for living your life: daily commutes, traveling abroad, handling your money, communicating with family, and much more! This places the responsibility of engineering top-notch software squarely in the laps of us developers. Unlike doctors, we were not required to take an oath or pledge when becoming Android Developers. However, we can still learn much from the principles behind the phrase, “First, do no harm.” In this talk, we will discuss over a dozen tools that are at your disposal as a developer which can enable you to provide high quality applications to your users. Thus allowing you to first, do no harm!</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.droidcon-boston.com/speakers/\"><a href=\"http://www.droidcon-boston.com/speakers/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.droidcon-boston.com/speakers/</a></a> </p> <p><img src=\"https://a248.e.akamai.net/secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/4/d/2/600_458734002.jpeg\" /></p> <p><b>Speaker Bio: </b>Chris Guzman - is a Developer Advocate at Nexmo where he helps developers use their global communications platform.

This doesn't mean, however, that a working knowledge of Android is the only skill developers need to be successful in IoT. Designing connected products means being responsible for the entire stack from the hardware to the cloud. In this presentation we will explore the peripherals, protocols, and practices that power today's IoT. You will walk away with a better understanding of what goes into building a connected device, and how a platform like Android Things fits into the overall picture. </p> <p><b>Speaker</b>  </p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/devunwired\">Dave Smith</a> is a Developer Advocate at Google, focused on IoT and the Android Things platform. Over the past decade, he has worked with low power M2M systems and wireless radio links, as well as custom applications and system components to run Android on embedded platforms. He has a passion for finding opportunities to make devices, and developers, smarter. </p> <p><b>Important: Due to limited space, please make sure you <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/DCAndroid/events/240968178/\">RSVP</a> if you're planning on attending.</b></p> <p>Mapbox will provide drinks and snacks.</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1502308437000,"duration":122400000,"id":"242416728","name":"Android Summit Conference - Thursday and Friday August 24-25th","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1503576000000,"local_date":"2017-08-24","local_time":"08:00","updated":1503926140000,"utc_offset":-14400000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":15,"venue":{"id":25418189,"name":"Sheraton Tysons Hotel","lat":38.930973052978516,"lon":-77.24617767333984,"repinned":false,"address_1":"8661 Leesburg Pike","city":"Tysons","country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA"},"group":{"created":1268219647000,"name":"Google Developer Group - Washington DC (GDG-DC)","id":1612017,"join_mode":"open","lat":38.93000030517578,"lon":-77.4000015258789,"urlname":"gdg-dc","who":"Google Techies and Users","localized_location":"Herndon, VA","state":"VA","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Eastern"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdg-dc/events/242416728/","description":"<p><img src=\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/4/a/5/600_463242149.jpeg\" /></p> <p>The <a href=\"http://meet.meetup.com/wf/click?upn=1CL8KZerddx3RoN8GG8tClaA-2BHkeavye0qDGEMeVXG-2BleRHQmkenUwb71jf3Ei03_1r8nhXHMnILkrNVfse95TBhRIge7eXAdE4dmHWkzTKu9HOECyhbjAQPwp-2FinD6LJgZeiH6QqmEf2ZHHtjivvBqmPmDkiHYHu9aKz0TgCl27Qgn6kOFl49qTDn8992iUwPdsjMYIbqrKvGq7oeN042q1WZRq2NOk5qHugLJcNRDRgKkAXH6pgqRPWjKMC0qc6CIVZfwoqrEnQl57UkC0EnJKy68dp2FjgMFW4WBqKy8Q-3D\">3rd annual Android Summit</a> will take place this August 24-25 at Sheraton Tyson's Corner Hotel! </p> <p>Expect to hear from speakers on topics exclusively about Android development, design, and testing.

Yet, the steep learning curve leaves many developers hesitant about adding it to their own Software tool belt. I was one such developer. Over the past two years, I’ve watched countless videos, read numerous blog posts and attended several conference talks on the subject. Yet, I often left each experience feeling only slightly more knowledgeable, but not quite empowered to start using RxJava in my apps. That’s not going to happen today!</p> <p>In this talk, we’re going to cover the bare minimum concepts you need to grok, in order to start using RxJava today.</p> <p>Reactive Programming is not going away any time soon. It’s a powerful way to create asynchronous, event-based applications. It allows developers the ability to craft applications that can easily combine multiple network calls, gracefully handle failures, all while providing a snappy user experience. I want everyone to feel comfortable with the basic concepts of RxJava.

Aside from Android, Nick's interests also include IoT, operating systems, and teaching undergraduates at The George Washington University.</p> <p>Description: Asynchronous programming, especially for networking, has always been a challenging problem for Android developers. Any good solution has to gracefully handle errors, cancellation, chaining multiple actions together, handle thread swapping, and much more.</p> <p>Kotlin’s coroutines are yet another option for asynchronous programming. However, unlike other popular contenders on Android, coroutines meet all the previously mentioned requirements out-of-the-box, have a gentler learning curve, and don’t require you to write an absurd amount of boilerplate. In fact, once you start using them, they will fundamentally change how you architect and write asynchronous code in your apps. That said, learning any new asynchronous solution takes time and often comes with a period of trial-and-error until you have all the nuances figured out. This talk serves to introduce Android developers to coroutines:</p> <p>(1) Lessen the learning curve by getting the subtleties of coroutines out of the way early<br/>(2) Learn how to work coroutines into an existing app: easy places to start transitioning, interop with existing libraries, and reusing existing threading constructs<br/>(3) Learn how to easily support error handling, cancellation, and task chaining with coroutines<br/>(4) Get tips on writing and improving automated tests with coroutines Get a head start on coroutines in your apps and easily write, test, and maintain asynchronous code like never before!</p> <p>Agenda:</p> <p>6:00-6:30 pm - Check-In &amp; Networking (with Food/Drinks)</p> <p>6:30 pm - Learn about Kotlin routines!</p> <p>7:30 pm - Q&amp;A/Networking/Socializing</p> <p>• What to bring<br/>Come up to the 2nd Floor Event Space and bring your parking ticket for validation</p> <p>• Important to know</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1520526562000,"duration":18000000,"id":"248541078","name":"Study Session for Google Code Jam 2018","rsvp_limit":100,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1522350000000,"local_date":"2018-03-29","local_time":"15:00","updated":1522372695000,"utc_offset":-14400000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":71,"venue":{"id":25464570,"name":"8020 Towers Crescent Dr","lat":38.9150505065918,"lon":-77.22051239013672,"repinned":false,"address_1":"8020 Towers Crescent Drive","city":"Vienna","country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA"},"group":{"created":1268219647000,"name":"Google Developer Group - Washington DC (GDG-DC)","id":1612017,"join_mode":"open","lat":38.93000030517578,"lon":-77.4000015258789,"urlname":"gdg-dc","who":"Google Techies and Users","localized_location":"Herndon, VA","state":"VA","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Eastern"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdg-dc/events/248541078/","description":"<p>• What we'll do<br/>GDG-DC team,</p> <p>We have quite the announcement!</p> <p>The official Google Code Jam 2018 registration is now open ( <a href=\"https://codejam.withgoogle.com/codejam/\" class=\"linkified\">https://codejam.withgoogle.com/codejam/</a> )!

AutoGraph automatically converts plain Python code into its TensorFlow equivalents, using source code transformation. For example, instead of tf.cond, and tf.while_loop, users would write imperative-style code with ifs and whiles, and expect it would be converted into its Graph equivalent. We aim to support other convenient Python constructs like lists, recurrent function calls, and list comprehensions, although we will not support the full Python language. Our approach is complementary with the new TensorFlow Eager project and will allow using the imperative style of Eager mode, while retaining the benefits of graph mode. By using automatic code conversion, developers can write code that’s more concise, efficient and robust.</p> <p>Speaker Bio: Alex Wiltschko is a senior research scientist at Google Brain.

Supervised learning delivers great benefits in one of the most sought-after applications from data scientists: predictive analytics models (including recommendation engines). But, the assumptions of labeled data and known classes are generally not true in unsupervised machine learning -- this is an example of a \"cold start problem\" -- when you have no prior knowledge to start with. This is a dilemma since unsupervised learning can be the path to true discovery through serendipitous data exploration and surprise detection in previously unseen data. So, how can you maximize the machine learning outcomes, benefits, and applications when faced with the cold start problem? We will discuss this challenge and some solutions with illustrative examples.</p> <p>Speaker: Dr. Tanushree Luke, Software Engineering at Capital One</p> <p>Title: Applications of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in the Banking Industry</p> <p>Agenda:<br/>6:00-6:30 pm - Check-In &amp; Networking (with Food/Drinks)<br/>6:30 pm - Catherine Ordun and Jared Sheehan, Welcome Keynote<br/>6:45 pm - Dr. Tanu Luke<br/>7:15 pm - Kirk Borne<br/>8:00 pm - Networking and Wrap-up</p> ","how_to_find_us":"Walk in the front door and its all the way in the back","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1540319363000,"duration":9000000,"id":"255776011","name":"AI / ML Meetup Series (4 of 4) - Pete Varvarezis (CapOne) & Adam Thompson Nvidia","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1542321000000,"local_date":"2018-11-15","local_time":"17:30","updated":1542335096000,"utc_offset":-18000000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":78,"venue":{"id":24685364,"name":"Booz Allen Hamilton Innovation Center","lat":38.90163040161133,"lon":-77.03302764892578,"repinned":true,"address_1":"901 15th Street Northwest, 1st floor, Washington, DC","city":"Washington","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"","state":"DC"},"group":{"created":1268219647000,"name":"Google Developer Group - Washington DC (GDG-DC)","id":1612017,"join_mode":"open","lat":38.93000030517578,"lon":-77.4000015258789,"urlname":"gdg-dc","who":"Google Techies and Users","localized_location":"Herndon, VA","state":"VA","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Eastern"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdg-dc/events/255776011/","description":"<p>Details<br/>AI and Machine Learning Enthusiasts!</p> <p>Your GDG-DC organizer team is so excited to announce a brand new meetup event!
