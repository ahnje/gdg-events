New Orleans is a hot bed for new ideas in education. This meetup will give you glimpse into what these edtech startups are working on and to share your technical expertise and feedback with them. Here's a bit about a few of the companies joining us:</p> <p>\"<b>Classroom Blueprint</b> is an online community where teachers share and discover best practices for classroom design. Teachers use our platform to publish their classroom spaces and the stories behind them, receiving colleagues' feedback and suggestions to further refine their setup. Leveraging this shared wisdom, teachers no longer need to waste precious time and resources recreating the wheel. Teachers -- new and experienced alike -- are able to efficiently find the best ideas and products to drive student achievement in their classrooms.\"</p> <p>\"<b>Dash4Teachers</b> is an iPhone app that allows Jedi teachers to create a daily list of parents to call and track data from those calls. Forgetting your clipboard or sticky notes, or even letting a student fall off your radar, will never be a problem again. Deborah Chang, who is a KIPP teacher that tested the app, commented, \"This is the app I always wish I had! I'm using it now while teaching summer school, and it's been AMAZING. Imagine never having to worry about how to contact parents, again.\"</p> <p>\"<b>Haystack EDU</b> is best described as Consumer Reports meets match dot come for teacher jobs. The objective of the organization is to build a more efficient and effective market place for teacher jobs. The idea is to give both teachers and schools a better line of site into each other earlier in the hiring process so that they waste less time searching and ultimately end up with better matches.\"</p> <p>\"<b>mangGO</b> is a mobile phone application that helps parents easily track, reinforce, and reward their child's health habits and behaviors. Building healthy habits early in life significantly impacts a kid's immediate and long-term health. mangGO focuses on 4 health habits shown to make the greatest difference on a child's health: intake of fruits and veggies, soda consumption, screen time, and physical activity.\"</p> <p>\"<b>My504HealthNet</b> (name will likely change soon) is a mobile application that instantly links residents to low and no cost community based health care. In 3 clicks, users can find a doctor near them based on their insurance status, medical need, and location. Not only does linking people to a doctor improve their health outcomes, it largely saves money -- Interim LSU Hospital alone spent $13.1 million dollars last year in uncompensated care costs for preventable emergency room visits. In a region that ranks in the top 10% for density of primary care providers, My504HealthNet seeks to link area residents to these doctors to make us healthier and save money in the process.\"</p> <p> </p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1346967853000,"id":"pssdtyqmbrb","name":"Backbone.js with Cory Fabre","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1347580800000,"local_date":"2012-09-13","local_time":"19:00","updated":1347623630000,"utc_offset":-18000000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":11,"group":{"created":1247798059000,"name":"GDG New Orleans","id":1491010,"join_mode":"open","lat":29.950000762939453,"lon":-90.12000274658203,"urlname":"gdg-new-orleans","who":"Members","localized_location":"New Orleans, LA","state":"LA","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Central"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdg-new-orleans/events/pssdtyqmbrb/","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1347646000000,"id":"pssdtyqnbpb","name":"Clojure with Eric Normand","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1350000000000,"local_date":"2012-10-11","local_time":"19:00","updated":1350604597000,"utc_offset":-18000000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":9,"group":{"created":1247798059000,"name":"GDG New Orleans","id":1491010,"join_mode":"open","lat":29.950000762939453,"lon":-90.12000274658203,"urlname":"gdg-new-orleans","who":"Members","localized_location":"New Orleans, LA","state":"LA","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Central"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdg-new-orleans/events/pssdtyqnbpb/","description":"<p>Introduction to Clojure</p> <p>Clojure is a functional, concurrency-friendly, and modern JVM-based language that is making waves in the wider programming world.

Remote pair programming is harder to accomplish, but is necessary as workplaces become composed of more distance workers. Learn why you should pair remotely and how to do it successfully through this fun story of my journey from cubicle land to productive remote pair guru.</p> <p>Not so long ago, I worked in a shop where the evil cubicle overlords sought domination by dividing the developer minions into single person teams. The land was divided into cubicle egg crates that removed any communication other than that which happened in hours long meetings. The developers were isolated and cut off from the world. They used headphones to block out any attempts at communication. Terms like \"Advancement of craft\" and \"Pursuit of exciting new languages\" were never spoken.</p> <p>As a lone developer, seated in a corner cubicle, I broke free and commenced a journey seeking out Ruby knowledge. Alas, I was the sole Ruby developer in a very small town. Armed with a laptop and microphone, my quest took led me on a journey through the interwebs of pair programming and google plus hangouts. Come along as our my story unfolds. Along the way, we'll go over the dark secrets of navigating the windows and panes of the mystical TMUX and Vim. We'll discuss the anti patterns to avoid and the patterns to follow that can ensure success.

This month's talk is:</p> <p>Kubernetes: So What and What Else<br/>The latest buzzword. You see it everywhere. What is it? Why all the hype? Kubernetes has certainly been the latest shiny object in software development and delivery lately. It certainly is an advancement in application packaging, deployment, operations, and application mobility, but it doesn't solve the entire application delivery problem. Join us to learn the basics of Kubernetes and its relationship to Docker Containers. Discover what all the hype is about and how it can help you delivery better applications. But beware, Kubernetes is not the entire solution.</p> <p>This month's talk is presented by:</p> <p>John Boudreaux, better known as Boosey (Boo-see), serves as the Chief Innovation Officer for Distribution Market, North America, for IBM. He has helped to develop and bring to market technologies and methodologies focusing on Application and Cognitive Computing Innovation Methodology. He works with clients to help them understand the process and technologies which every company can use to create solutions that are not just inventive, but achieve the desired business outcomes. Boosey has been on the leading edge of technology for his entire career beginning in the IBM Lab in 1987 where he worked on advanced technology that produced the first market successful visual development environment, and through the years has continued to be on the leading edge which now includes containerization, cognitive computing and artificial intelligence, cloud, Blockchain, and IoT.</p> <p>We look forward to seeing you at our event!

From higher mobile search rankings to bottom-line revenue impacts, performance can make or break your web app. However, fixing performance can feel like a quagmire of expert-level nuanced understanding on so many topics. What would you think if I told you you could cut your JavaScript bundle size up to 50% by doing one thing only? Nearly 90% of worldwide web traffic runs on modern browsers, but we're transpiling all of our JavaScript down to ES5. That transpilation has a cost.</p> <p>In this talk, we'll learn about differential serving, or serving modern bundles to modern browsers and legacy, transpiled bundles to older browsers. We'll talk about strategies, what to watch out for, and how to implement it using webpack. This talk is framework agnostic, and it's best if you have at least a basic understand of JavaScript.</p> <p>GDG New Orleans is a monthly meeting where developers can present on any topic related to technology and software development.
