Our one-day conference is aimed at mobile technology enthusiasts who are interested in a quick update on the latest developments announced at Google I/O and WWDC.</p> <p><a href=\"http://mrw.gdg.nz\">Mobile Refresh</a> will provide content for designers, developers, testers, or just about anyone passionate about mobile development. The vast majority of the sessions will be interactive. The conference takes a split approach: the morning is reserved for panel discussions and Q&amp;A, while the afternoon is going to follow an un-conference format where the audience decides the discussion topics.</p> <p>Attendees should expect discussions that cover both iOS and Android. The two platforms solve similar problems (albeit with different approaches), and it is our hope that at the end of the day everyone will have learned new things.</p> <p>This event is made possible by these generous sponsors: Google, Trade Me, Victoria University, LilRegie, PaperKite, and Powershop.
