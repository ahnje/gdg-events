For the<br/>full experience, audience members should be comfortable programming,<br/>ideally in Python, and be comfortable with basic algebra. This workshop will give attendees a start on the MLCC materials, which provide an additional 16 hours of self-study exercises. The MLCC is designed to enable you to use machine learning within your everyday projects, and to benefit from the power of TensorFlow wrapped in convenient higher-level abstractions.</p> <p>Course website: <a href=\"https://g.co/mledu/studyjams\" class=\"linkified\">https://g.co/mledu/studyjams</a></p> <p>Speaker:</p> <p>David Steines is an algorithm developer at IDEXX Laboratories. He started using machine learning in graduate school, where he built Brain-Computer Interfaces to control robots and help paralyzed people spell sentences, simply by imagining moving or staring at a grid of flashing letters. Once he was hooked on machine learning, David entered industry and has used machine learning to control robots that are conducting chemistry experiments, and to identify blood cells on laser flow cytometers to diagnose diseases. In his role at IDEXX, he uses Tensorflow and machine learning to build cutting-edge diagnostic algorithms for the veterinary industry, including looking for crystals and other objects in urine sediment image, or identifying diseases in x-rays. He is thrilled to share his experiences with the Portland Google Developer Group!</p> <p>Facilitators:</p> <p>Clare Bates Congdon is Senior Research Scientist at Introspective Systems. She has been working in Machine Learning for over 25 years, and teaching Computer Science for over 20 years. Her expertise includes machine learning, artificial intelligence, genetic algorithms, and complex adaptive systems. Her work in machine learning and bioinformatics has been funded by both the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health. Her work in intelligent agents and games has won four international competitions. She is active in international professional organizations, and has been Chair of the IEEE CIS Technical Committee on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering, and Vice Chair of the IEEE CIS Technical Committee on Games. Congdon holds a BA in Mathematics from Wesleyan University and an MS and PhD in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Michigan.</p> <p>Carleton Ericson has worked at IDEXX since 2013 and is finishing up his MS in computer science this fall from Georgia Tech (specializing in machine learning), where he also was a teaching assistant for the Computer Vision class. He has applied machine learning to many computer vision problems, including microscopic cell identification and automated reading of SNAP test results.</p> <p>Kevin Hanselman has been a Software Engineer at IDEXX for five years. Also enrolled in Georgia Tech's OMSCS program, he is finishing up his master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in machine learning. Between school and work, Kevin has applied machine learning to a variety of domains, including stock trading, object tracking in video, autonomous path-finding, semantic image segmentation, and predicting clinical results from medical imaging.</p> <p>Note: RSVP required.</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1542548253000,"duration":14400000,"id":"256515837","name":"GDG Holiday Event","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1545082200000,"local_date":"2018-12-17","local_time":"16:30","updated":1552323370000,"utc_offset":-18000000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":20,"venue":{"id":24912942,"name":"Sea Dog Brewing Co..","lat":43.619998931884766,"lon":-70.29000091552734,"repinned":true,"address_1":"125 Western Ave, SouthME 04106","city":"South Portland","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"04106","state":"ME"},"group":{"created":1504842163000,"name":"GDG Portland-Maine","id":25832508,"join_mode":"open","lat":43.65999984741211,"lon":-70.26000213623047,"urlname":"GDG-Portland-Maine","who":"Members","localized_location":"Portland, ME","state":"ME","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Eastern"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Portland-Maine/events/256515837/","manual_attendance_count":10,"description":"<p>Let's Jingle and Mingle!<br/>The most exciting time of the year has come: Holiday Parties &amp; Gifts.
