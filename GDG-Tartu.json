Join us on November 28th at Bolt where we'll have two exciting talks from two different fields.</p> <p>Our first speaker, Yaroslav, will walk us through the pitfalls of capturing screen contents on Android. Getting a pixel-perfect screenshot is a much more complicated task than it may seem at first. There is no single right way for doing this - only compromises and tradeoffs.</p> <p>Next up we have Denys who's sharing his experience in scaling data science in Bolt. He'll get deep into the journey of building an in-house feature store and how it helped Bolt to serve real-time requests on a global scale.</p> <p>The meetup will take place on the 28th of November at the Bolt office (Riia 2, in Tartu Kvartal mall.

The last days of the year 2019. The last days of the decade! You thought we're done? Not even close!<br/>You've been waiting, you've been making jokes, you've been wondering whether or not it's a long-running prank. Very soon you'll have the chance to resolve all these burning questions.</p> <p>December 18th, at Mobispace at Akadeemia 3. Join us for the unprecedented workshop-style GDG Tartu event. Grab your laptop and dive into the wonderful world of new possibilities for building cool new applications with GraalVM. Learn with Oleg about what you can do with it, try it on your applications and discover its beauty! Get amazed by how your Java code can compete in having the ms startup times with native apps without making you reinvent generics every single time!</p> <p>Build polyglot apps by mixing dynamic languages like you actually can pick the best tool for the job rather than the best tool in your language ecosystem. Python, Ruby, R, JavaScipt, WebAssembly, you'd think it'll quickly become an unmanageable mess guaranteeing you job security for centuries to come. Be amazed how the common tooling can help you debug even the most complicated polyglot apps with breeze.</p> <p>Or just start the benchmarks and hang out with your peers waiting for the results. How many cups of coffee can you drink while you code computes the first 10^100 prime numbers? Join us and let's find out? *</p> <p>*We don't actually have that much coffee, we have soft drinks and water.</p> <p>The event is hosted by Mobispace and drinks are provided by our friends at Mobi Lab</p> <p>PS. this is an exclusive event, spots are limited, hurry up and really, people, we absolutely need you to bring your laptops.
