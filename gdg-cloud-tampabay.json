Until recently, all best practices and recommendations were pointing to 3-tier architecture, and that is how our monolith .NET applications were born.</p> <p>However, scalability issues can arise in this type of architecture. That set our company us on a quest to find new architecture patterns and associated technologies that would solve this problem and solve it quickly. In less than 3 months we were able to adopt Kubernetes (GKE) and a micro-services architecture, which allowed us to achieve 1000x scalability, rapid reaction to spikes, all while in the same time reducing DB load and even cost.</p> <p>In this talk, I want to share steps, challenges, solutions, surprises and issues that we saw during this transition. I hope that our experience would be useful for those who are on the same path now, planning to start on it soon, or just curious about Kubernetes. While it was a .NET application in our case, most things are applicable to any monolith application.</p> <p>Speaker bio:<br/>Artem Nikulchenko works as a Chief Software Architect in Teamwork Commerce (leading company in the space of retail management solutions that provides a completely mobile, cloud-based solution that is used by retail chains in USA, Canada, Brazil, Mexico, Japan, China, Europe and Great Britain) and part-time Associate Professor in Kharkiv National Technical University.
