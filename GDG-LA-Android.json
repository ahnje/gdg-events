RSVPs will close at noon the day of the event.</p> <p>PARKING<br/>If you will be driving yourself, the best place to park is at the Promenade at Howard Hughes Center. The entrance to the parking garage is on Park Terrace. From Sepulveda, turn onto Center Drive, continue to the first traffic light and take a left. You will see a large HHLA sign over the garage. Google Maps will want you to take a U-turn at Park Terrace, but don't do it!</p> <p>The first 30 minutes are free, then 1 hour of parking is $2, and 4 hours of parking is $3. This is a much cheaper option that the two visitor parking garages located closer to the Appetize office at 6601 Center Dr W, which are $2 for each 15 minutes.</p> <p>Participants and sponsors are expected to adhere to our Code of Conduct (CoC), which can be found here: <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/gdglaandroid-coc\" class=\"linkified\">https://tinyurl.com/gdglaandroid-coc</a></p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false}],"upcoming":[],"organizers":[{"id":23692681,"name":"Siena A.","bio":"Senior Software Engineer at Indiegogo.","status":"active","joined":1314319335000,"city":"Culver City","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","state":"CA","lat":34.01,"lon":-118.39,"photo":{"id":283134764,"highres_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/d/5/e/c/highres_283134764.jpeg","photo_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/d/5/e/c/member_283134764.jpeg","thumb_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/d/5/e/c/thumb_283134764.jpeg","type":"member","base_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com"},"group_profile":{"status":"active","visited":1573416623000,"created":1562087646000,"updated":1564693768000,"role":"coorganizer","group":{"id":31382820,"urlname":"GDG-LA-Android","name":"GDG Los Angeles Android","status":"active","who":"Members","members":229,"join_mode":"open","localized_location":"Los Angeles, CA"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-LA-Android/members/23692681/"},"is_pro_admin":false},{"id":27906282,"name":"Marcos P.","status":"active","joined":1318525824000,"city":"Los Angeles","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","state":"CA","lat":34.1,"lon":-118.33,"photo":{"id":286025060,"highres_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/1/3/c/4/highres_286025060.jpeg","photo_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/1/3/c/4/member_286025060.jpeg","thumb_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/1/3/c/4/thumb_286025060.jpeg","type":"member","base_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com"},"group_profile":{"status":"active","visited":1582051307000,"created":1552508672000,"updated":1552510193000,"role":"organizer","group":{"id":31382820,"urlname":"GDG-LA-Android","name":"GDG Los Angeles Android","status":"active","who":"Members","members":229,"join_mode":"open","localized_location":"Los Angeles, CA"},"intro":"Marcos is a Senior Android Engineer at Tinder.
