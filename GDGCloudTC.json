Details below.</p> <p>Venue this month is Improving in Bloomington (where we had the November Meetup).</p> <p>Main presentation details:</p> <p>Video Like a Boss: Enterprise Video in the Cloud<br/>70% of internet traffic is video content. Globally, the average person who watches online video does so for seven hours every week, and this amount — including video for work or education — is growing every year. In this presentation, we’ll take a developer’s view at how pre-recorded video is delivered online. We’ll review the steps it takes to get video from “glass-to-glass”: Ingestion, Transcoding, Storage, Enrichment, Packaging, Delivery, and Playback. Understanding these steps will allow any developer to build the cloud-based workflows required to deliver video for common use cases, such as e-commerce (e.g. video product reviews), learning (e.g. training and on-boarding videos), and digital signage. We will finish by looking at the cutting edge of video delivery: Google’s Video AI cloud service, and low-latency live streaming.</p> <p>Bio<br/>Eugene is the Head of Engineering, Professional Services, at Kaltura. His team works on customized video platform solutions for the world’s largest enterprises and educational institutions.</p> ","how_to_find_us":"Improving is in the Northland Plaza Towers\n3600 American Blvd West, Suite #115 · Bloomington, MN 55431\n\nPark in front of the 3600 building and walk in the main entrance then head into the Improving entrance on your left.
