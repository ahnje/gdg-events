It takes a different approach to cross platform development than Xamarin and other frameworks. This talk will be about how to setup and build a multiplatform project. We will look at features of Kotlin multiplatform development through an example project. We will also look at the current limitations.</p> <p>Speaker Bios:</p> <p>Johnstone is an Android Engineer and a Kotlin advocate. Prior to building Android apps, he was a Backend Engineer.
