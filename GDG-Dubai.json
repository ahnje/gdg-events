Go makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software. </p> <p>Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the convenience of garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection. It's a fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language. </p> <p><img src=\"https://ci4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/QA4hdx774WXHXBKp-5q71QVgrvdvKz6nnqKhqYHAqkERU80HeC_4kyi1LLRfHvRZUkhethHO0WclxTWzR7-64ejaprxESCOtYK17B1Wj4FPkXVzGjTNveA04Dtfw4KVzoz4YJMM1iOK7mihqOLhpau2_CFXskY6idYGRO1k=s0-d-e1-ft#https://gallery.mailchimp.com/8ea4d6269eb7c9afa2e5e0a28/images/13ca9b84-f49c-4007-b9f5-35827b354bbd.png\" /> About The Speaker</p> <p>Francesc Campoy Flores is a Developer Advocate for Go and the Cloud at Google.
