Well, this is obviously not the case. Proper UX Design follows a clear and rational process. This talk is for UX unicorn believers, developers or designers who work with developers and it aims to demystify a user centered UX process by showing a practical and rational UX process from start to finish.</p> <p>Machine Learning for Designers<br/>_____________________________________________________________________<br/>Artificial Intelligence sits at the core of the biggest transformation of our industry: the convergence of Industrial Design, Interaction Design and Service Design forming a new mega-discipline. With it comes the need for designers to evolve into new fields, one of which is Machine Learning.<br/>This talk is about what Machine Learning is, how it is driving the change in our industry, and what of it is important for designers.</p> <p>Memi is an experience designer with more backgrounds than a Wes Anderson movie. He's a college dropout (English Literature &amp; Linguistics) and a trained film director. He's been writing code since he was 13, with absolutely no ambition other than to see what happens. This ambition got him to the field of UX where he enjoys finding out what people need, building it and having a good cry after testing.<br/>He is curious and if you give him a stick and a bear, he'll know what to do. He's not good at sports, so you might reconsider.</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1531751636000,"duration":7200000,"id":"gtpqzpyxlbmb","name":"WTM & GDG Stammtisch","rsvp_limit":12,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1533834000000,"local_date":"2018-08-09","local_time":"19:00","updated":1536266478000,"utc_offset":7200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":8,"venue":{"id":21708272,"name":"Cafe Henrici","lat":47.3726806640625,"lon":8.543609619140625,"repinned":false,"address_1":"Niederdorfstrasse 1","city":"Zürich","country":"ch","localized_country_name":"Switzerland"},"group":{"created":1506375675000,"name":"Women Techmakers Switzerland","id":26051944,"join_mode":"open","lat":47.380001068115234,"lon":8.539999961853027,"urlname":"wtm-switzerland","who":"Members","localized_location":"Zürich, Switzerland","state":"","country":"ch","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Zurich"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/wtm-switzerland/events/gtpqzpyxlbmb/","manual_attendance_count":8,"description":"<p>• What we'll do<br/>Meeting interesting people, talk about tech, socialise, network or whatever floats your boat ;-)</p> <p>• Important to know<br/>This is an event hosted by GDG (Google developer group), as well as WTM (Women Techmakers) and aims at bringing people together and foster a diverse environment.

So, what about making our solutions smarter without any knowledge of AI? In this session, we’ll see how to transform or extract information from text, image, audio &amp; video with the latest ML APIs, how to train an AutoML custom model, and we’ll be active players of a live demo.

How many Android devices can update to the newest OS version after 2 years? In case you are a mobile developer, how it feels supporting different OS versions that can behave completely different? How many times have you wished to use any language as a first-class citizen for mobile development? In this talk we will show how Fuchsia addresses the former problems with its modular design and its new kernel created from scratch (no Linux here); its use of AI; and its UI SDK, based on Flutter, which also lets you reuse the app for Android and iOS (and other desktop OS and the web in the near future). But it doesn't stop here, and Fuchsia will be the OS for any kind of device, from IoT devices to the Cloud.</p> <p>19.00 - 19.45 - New kid in the BLoC, Filipe A. Barroso.

The Kubernetes framework is well suited to address these issues, which is why it’s a great foundation for deploying ML products. Kubeflow is designed to take advantage of these benefits.</p> <p>Kubeflow makes it easy for everyone to develop, deploy, and manage portable, scalable ML everywhere and supports the full lifecycle of an ML product, including iteration via Jupyter notebooks. It removes the need for expertise in a large number of areas, reducing the barrier to entry for developing and maintaining ML products. The composability problem is addressed by providing a single, unified tool for running common processes such as data ingestion, transformation, and analysis, model training, evaluation, and serving, as well as monitoring, logging, and other operational tools. The portability problem is resolved by supporting the use of the entire stack either locally, on-premise, or on the cloud platform of your choice. Scalability is native to the Kubernetes platform and leveraged by Kubeflow to run all aspects of the product, including resource-intensive model training tasks.<br/>Michelle Casbon demonstrates how to build a machine learning application with Kubeflow. By providing a platform that reduces variability between services and environments, Kubeflow enables applications that are more robust and resilient, resulting in less downtime, quality issues, and customer impact. Additionally, it supports the use of specialized hardware such as GPUs, which can reduce operational costs and improve model performance. Join Michelle to find out what Kubeflow currently supports and the long-term vision for the project.</p> ","how_to_find_us":"The room is located at the Google Offices, Kasernenstrasse 95, directly next to the main station.

The process took about four months and 200 TiB of storage. Record-breaking Pi calculations have traditionally been done on supercomputers and special-made hardware, but we did it on Cloud for the first time. This talk will discuss the nature of the calculation, the architecture, challenges and techniques, and of course the brief history of Pi computation. Calculating Pi has been the speaker's childhood dream and this talk will also explain how the small dream grew to the new world record.</p> <p>Background:<br/>As a child, Iwao became interested in pi. She was inspired by Japanese mathematicians, including Yasumasa Kanada. She studied computer science at the University of Tsukuba, She was awarded the Dean's Award for Excellence in 2008, before starting graduate studies in computing. Her master's dissertation considered high performance computer systems.After graduating, Iwao took on several software engineering positions, working on site reliability for Panasonic, GREE and Red Hat.</p> <p>Career<br/>After joining Google in 2015, Iwao became a Cloud Developer Advocate in 2017. She originally worked for Google in Tokyo, before moving to Seattle in 2019. Iwao focuses on the use of the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), as well as supporting application developers. She works to make cloud computing accessible for everyone, creating online demos and teaching materials.</p> ","how_to_find_us":"Reception Building 100, Room: Tech Talks 100","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1554913315000,"duration":7200000,"id":"chdcwqyzlblb","name":"WTM & GDG Stammtisch","rsvp_limit":12,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1565283600000,"local_date":"2019-08-08","local_time":"19:00","updated":1565294518000,"utc_offset":7200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":6,"venue":{"id":26315626,"name":"Nachtflug","lat":47.37260818481445,"lon":8.543437004089355,"repinned":false,"address_1":"Stüssihofstatt 4","city":"Zürich","country":"ch","localized_country_name":"Switzerland"},"group":{"created":1506375675000,"name":"Women Techmakers Switzerland","id":26051944,"join_mode":"open","lat":47.380001068115234,"lon":8.539999961853027,"urlname":"wtm-switzerland","who":"Members","localized_location":"Zürich, Switzerland","state":"","country":"ch","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Zurich"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/wtm-switzerland/events/chdcwqyzlblb/","description":"<p>• What we'll do<br/>Meeting interesting people, talk about tech, socialise, network or whatever floats your boat ;-)</p> <p>• Important to know<br/>This is an event hosted by GDG (Google developer group), as well as WTM (Women Techmakers) and aims at bringing people together and foster a diverse environment.

Through trials, triumphs and tribulations, I discovered the life I truly want to create for myself: empowering women to live their happiest lives, drawing from my research superpowers, obsession with self-development and personal experience living abroad.

Your submission will then be reviewed by the conference organizers during the selection process. Many factors play into account if you get selected, so sometimes, it will take many applications.</p> <p>This workshop is for anyone who wants to learn how to write a good CFP that has good chances of being selected. It is initiated by the VoxxedDays Zurich conference organizers to motivate new speakers from diverse backgrounds to participate in their CFP, which is closing on November 24th. At the end of the workshop, you can submit your abstract to VoxxedDays Zurich or any other conference of interest.</p> <p>Why should I speak at a conference?<br/>Attending conferences gives you many networking opportunities with your industry, potential clients, and new colleagues. Also, being a speaker provides you more exposure than a regular attendee. You will also be invited to exclusive events and premises complementing the conference, where you will meet international speakers and the event organizers. Speaking will make you approachable for attendee discussions and feedback, which will lead to new insights and ideas to bring home. You will gain reputation in your field, and it is also extremely beneficial for your company. Conferences often cover speaker travel and accommodation fees; this is great to grow your network internationally.</p> <p>I don’t know what to speak about...<br/>A common misconception is that only experts speak at conferences. However, the most important thing attendees seek is to learn about unknown concepts around technology and to get inspired. As individuals, we have unique perspectives, knowledge, and interests that we can share with others. In this workshop, we will help you brainstorm exciting topics that are tailored to you and find the right conference to apply to. Many conferences also offer first-time speaker mentoring, so you feel most prepared for your talk.</p> <p>I am not good in front of crowds…<br/>Many renowned speakers have stated that they are introverted and still get nervous before a presentation. Stage fright is entirely reasonable for most humans. For introverts, a conference can be exhausting. But if you avoid talking to anyone – it can hurt your career and business. As a speaker, you will get approached by attendees, and you can skip the pressure of doing small-talk as you can jump right into a discussion about your field of interest. Access to speaker rooms enables introverts to have enough down-time away from the crowd.</p> ","how_to_find_us":"Stickers will lead you to the rooms.","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1572687830000,"duration":10800000,"id":"266157408","name":"Flutter Interact: Viewing Party","rsvp_limit":50,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1576083600000,"local_date":"2019-12-11","local_time":"18:00","updated":1576101217000,"utc_offset":3600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":22,"venue":{"id":26654436,"name":"Google Europaallee H","lat":47.3797721862793,"lon":8.529582023620605,"repinned":false,"address_1":"Lagerstrasse 100","city":"Zürich","country":"ch","localized_country_name":"Switzerland"},"group":{"created":1506375675000,"name":"Women Techmakers Switzerland","id":26051944,"join_mode":"open","lat":47.380001068115234,"lon":8.539999961853027,"urlname":"wtm-switzerland","who":"Members","localized_location":"Zürich, Switzerland","state":"","country":"ch","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Zurich"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/wtm-switzerland/events/266157408/","description":"<p>Flutter Interact is an event that will be broadcasted from Brooklyn NY.
