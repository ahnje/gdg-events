He fell in love with programming at age 14 on his TI-99/4A and has since worked on everything from a spaceborne GPS receiver to Internet banking and mobile apps. An electrical engineer by training, Chandler got hooked on building Web database applications in the days of NCSA Mosaic and has written Web apps in C, perl, ksh, ColdFusion, JSF, GWT + App Engine, and Dart. Most recently, he has focused on mobile apps with a special interest in the mobile Web and cloud data synchronization. Chandler holds a patent on a method of organizing hierarchical data in a relational database and blogs about Java Web and mobile development at <a href=\"http://turbomanage.wordpress.com/\">turbomanage.wordpress.com</a>. His most recent open source project is stORM, a lightweight DAO generator for Android SQLite. Outside work, Chandler is an avid outdoor photographer and enjoys teaching math and computer science in a homeschool co-op.</p> <p>Project <b><a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/storm-gen/\">stORM</a></b>: an open source ORM for SQLite on Android<br/>Android’s bundled SQLite database is powerful, but requires a lot of hand-coded SQL to get started. Using an ORM can simplify database development for many applications, and the Android ecosystem already has several to choose from. stORM is a lightweight DAO generator written by Android Developer Advocate David Chandler that aims for a streamlined developer experience (only two annotations required) and solid performance (preferring code generation over reflection). stORM is extensible, minimally intrusive, and offers built-in CSV backup / restore capabilities to facilitate database version upgrades. Along with stORM, Chandler will present basic-http-client, a lightweight Java HTTP client with a built-in asynchronous interface.</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1361381276000,"id":"105524652","name":"Google Compute Engine at Agosto","rsvp_limit":40,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1363820400000,"local_date":"2013-03-20","local_time":"18:00","updated":1363874027000,"utc_offset":-18000000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":40,"venue":{"id":10477152,"name":"Agosto Inc","lat":44.983306884765625,"lon":-93.27772521972656,"repinned":false,"address_1":"420 5th St N #400","city":"Minneapolis","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"55401","state":"MN"},"group":{"created":1296658597000,"name":"Google Developers Group - Twin Cities","id":1776979,"join_mode":"open","lat":44.97999954223633,"lon":-93.2300033569336,"urlname":"gdg-tc","who":"Google Developers","localized_location":"Minneapolis, MN","state":"MN","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Central"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdg-tc/events/105524652/","manual_attendance_count":18,"description":"<p>Join us at the Agosto Headquarters for a presentation and discussion on Google Compute Engine by Paul Lundberg.</p> <p>Tentative Schedule:</p> <p>6PM - Food &amp; beverages &amp; networking.</p> <p>6:30 - 8PM Presentation: Overview of Google Cloud Platform.  The overview will be cover App Engine (Platform-as-a-Service), Compute Engine (Infrastructure-as-a-Service) with a brief overview of the other offerings under GCP.

When you combine Firebase with Angular's legendary two-way binding, what you end up with is a revolutionary way of crafting front-end javascript applications using what has been coined \"three-way binding\". When you have a direct and immediate connection to the database from your client-side application you can create truly magical user experiences.

It requires a shift in thinking and design that you may not have wanted to make. In this talk, I’ll go over some of the history behind why RecyclerView was needed, what are the components you need to know and then move on to some of the awesome tips and tricks to help you get the most out of this game changing tool.<br/>What do I know? I’ve been developing for Android for about six years, work for a startup out of California developing apps for numerous customers, and literally have a degree in rocket science. That means I can definitely say learning RecyclerView isn’t rocket science and you should start today.</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1483466056000,"duration":34200000,"fee":{"accepts":"wepay","amount":40,"currency":"USD","description":"per person","label":"price","required":true},"id":"236641322","name":"DevFestMN 2017","rsvp_limit":2,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1486218600000,"local_date":"2017-02-04","local_time":"08:30","rsvp_open_offset":"PT31H30M","rsvp_close_offset":"PT31H","updated":1498667575000,"utc_offset":-21600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":5,"venue":{"id":23509530,"name":"UST Schulze School of Entrepreneurship","lat":44.97390365600586,"lon":-93.2776107788086,"repinned":false,"address_1":"46 s. 11th st.","city":"Minneapolis","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"","state":"MN"},"group":{"created":1296658597000,"name":"Google Developers Group - Twin Cities","id":1776979,"join_mode":"open","lat":44.97999954223633,"lon":-93.2300033569336,"urlname":"gdg-tc","who":"Google Developers","localized_location":"Minneapolis, MN","state":"MN","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Central"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdg-tc/events/236641322/","manual_attendance_count":468,"description":"<p>Please register at <a href=\"https://devfestmn.eventbrite.com\" class=\"linkified\">https://devfestmn.eventbrite.com</a></p> <p>Full details - <a href=\"http://devfest.mn\"><a href=\"http://devfest.mn\" class=\"linkified\">http://devfest.mn</a></a></p> <p>Looking forward to seeing you there!</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1485192295000,"id":"237139766","name":"UX/UI topic: fear as a catalyst to empathize with an audience","rsvp_limit":45,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1488933000000,"local_date":"2017-03-07","local_time":"18:30","updated":1498667563000,"utc_offset":-21600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":42,"venue":{"id":10477152,"name":"Agosto Inc","lat":44.983306884765625,"lon":-93.27772521972656,"repinned":false,"address_1":"420 5th St N #400","city":"Minneapolis","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"55401","state":"MN"},"group":{"created":1296658597000,"name":"Google Developers Group - Twin Cities","id":1776979,"join_mode":"open","lat":44.97999954223633,"lon":-93.2300033569336,"urlname":"gdg-tc","who":"Google Developers","localized_location":"Minneapolis, MN","state":"MN","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Central"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdg-tc/events/237139766/","manual_attendance_count":33,"description":"<p><img src=\"https://a248.e.akamai.net/secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/6/9/e/600_422214942.jpeg\" /></p> <p>We are excited this month to have <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/112160340542694494899?prsrc=4\">Bryce Howitson</a>, a local Google Developer Expert in UI/UX join us at Agosto.</p> <p><b>Tentative Schedule </b><br/>6:30 - Snacks and socializing *<br/>7:00 - Short greeting and intro by GDG Organizer<br/>7:15 - <b>Fear as a catalyst to empathize with an audience and create engaging products</b><br/> Synopsis: learn how emotions effect interaction, understanding and expectations to truly connect with your audience.

Is it getting VMs and your stack running on it? Is it switching from Microsoft Word to Google Docs? What if I'm a developer who wants to avoid doing DevOps work and just get their code online and accessible globally as quickly as possible? This session begins with a (believe it or not) vendor-agnostic, high-level overview of cloud computing, including its three primary service levels. This is followed by an overview of Google Cloud, its plethora of APIs from both GCP &amp; G Suite, and which products serve at which cloud service levels. This session is followed by deeper dives into our serverless and ML/AI APIs.</p> <p>2) Running code using Google Cloud serverless (Ryan Matsumoto)</p> <p>Learn more about Google Cloud Platform's serverless computing products: App Engine and Cloud Functions. We'll cover advantages of serverless computing, key features, and demos to show you how to get started.</p> <p>3) Democratizing AI (Marc Cohen)</p> <p>An overview of Google's Cloud AI services in three parts: 1) access rich, pre-trained models via simple API calls, 2) deploy your own TensorFlow or Keras models to train and serve in the cloud, and 3) AutoML, which offers a balance between ease of use and customizability.</p> <p>I hope you can join us for this special event.</p> <p>Thank you to our sponsor Agosto for the presentation room and food.</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1549561936000,"duration":10800000,"id":"258765639","name":"International Women's Day event featuring Ashley McCray (IWD '19)","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1554244200000,"local_date":"2019-04-02","local_time":"17:30","updated":1554262301000,"utc_offset":-18000000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":62,"venue":{"id":26139949,"name":"Nerdery","lat":44.83100509643555,"lon":-93.30043029785156,"repinned":true,"address_1":"9555 James Ave S #245","city":"Bloomington","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"55431","state":"MN"},"group":{"created":1296658597000,"name":"Google Developers Group - Twin Cities","id":1776979,"join_mode":"open","lat":44.97999954223633,"lon":-93.2300033569336,"urlname":"gdg-tc","who":"Google Developers","localized_location":"Minneapolis, MN","state":"MN","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Central"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdg-tc/events/258765639/","description":"<p>In honor of International Women's Month, let's talk about the numbers.

We have two excellent talks from awesome speakers.<br/>==========<br/>'Which Whiskey? Using GCP to Predict Whiskey Preferences'</p> <p>What happens when a guy's passions for whiskey and the cloud collide? The answer is a clever solution built entirely with Google products, and an ML model that will predict which whiskies to try! In this talk, Phil will talk through his passion for whiskey (and his problem of too many choices), the solution he built on G Suite and GCP, and how using simple yet powerful tools can change not just your passion projects, but your organization's projects as well!</p> <p>Speaker:<br/>Phil Goerdt is the Founder of Erteso, a consultancy that focuses on helping customers move to and get the most out of GCP. He's been consulting on data and the cloud for over 8 years, and when he isn't thinking about either of those, you can probably find him hunting for new foods or whiskies to try.<br/>==========</p> <p>GCP Production Grade Infrastructure in 45 Minutes</p> <p>As a developer, you want to write code that does cool stuff. The last thing you want to think about is underlying infrastructure. In this talk, we'll discuss the definition of production-grade and what falls under the umbrella of infrastructure. We'll also present a GCP infrastructure design that meets our criteria outlined above and deploy it in a live demo. All in 45 mins!</p> <p>Speakers:<br/>Davis Pynadath: Davis is a Strategic Cloud Engineer with the Google Cloud Professional Services Organization. He helps customers design their networking infrastructure with an emphasis on high availability, scalability, security and automation.<br/>Mohamed Himedan: Mo is an Infrastructure Consultant with the Google Cloud Professional Services Organization. His primary charter is helping customers design their cloud infrastructure.
