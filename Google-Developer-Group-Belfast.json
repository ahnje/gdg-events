As an Android developer, you almost certainly slotted into the “frontend” category, with no responsibility on the backend. And if you do want to work on the backend for an app, it can be taxing to learn new tools and languages, while being responsible for managing and scaling a server farm.</p> <p>Today, with “serverless” backends becoming popular, server management and scaling is being fully automated, and you can use many of the same tools and languages you use for Android development. Do you want to write Kotlin everywhere? There’s a solution for you! Join this talk to survey some serverless options provided by Google, see some demos, and figure out which options are right for you.</p> <p>We'll also have Andy Hayes from Puppet speaking too.
