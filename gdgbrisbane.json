Talks will start at 12:30pm sharp, and we'll wrap up by 4pm.</p> <p>Please RSVP on the <b>GDG Cloud Meetup event page</b> <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Cloud-Brisbane/events/241812900/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Cloud-Brisbane/events/241812900/</a>.</p> <p>AGENDA: <br/>------------- <br/><b>Opening: Tracey Kay (Axalon), Dan King (Axalon), Dale Freya (AginicX) <br/></b>Introducing GDG Cloud and GDG Brisbane, and providing an overview of the event and Google Cloud Platform in Australia.</p> <p><b>Session 1: Machine Learning APIs by Example - Sara Robinson (Google) <br/></b>Think your business could make use of Google's machine learning expertise when it comes to powering and improving your business applications, but do you get stuck on building and training your own custom model? Google Cloud Platform (GCP) offers four APIs: Google Cloud Vision API, Cloud Speech API, Cloud Natural Language API, and Cloud Translation API. These APIs access pre-trained machine learning models with a single API call. In this session, we'll share an overview of each API. Then we'll dive into code with a live demo.</p> <p>Sara is a Developer Advocate on Google's Cloud Platform team, focusing on big data and machine learning. She helps developers build awesome apps through demos, online content, and events. Sara has a bachelor’s degree in Business and International Studies from Brandeis University. When she's not programming she can be found on a spin bike, listening to the Hamilton soundtrack, or finding the best ice cream in New York.</p> <p><b>Session 2: Apache Beam and Google Cloud Dataflow - Mete Atamal (Google) <br/></b>In this session, we will take a look at the history of massive-scale data processing at Google and how it has evolved over the years. We will learn about Apache Beam, an open source programming model unifying batch and stream processing and see how Apache Beam pipelines can be executed in Google Cloud Dataflow, a fully-managed cloud service for batch and stream data processing.</p> <p>Mete is a Developer Advocate at Google, currently focused on helping developers with Google Cloud Platform. As a long-time Java and a recent C# developer, I like to compare the two ecosystems. Prior to Google, I worked at Microsoft, Skype, Adobe, EMC, and Nokia building apps and services on various web, mobile and cloud platforms. Originally from Cyprus, I currently live in Greenwich, not too far away from the prime meridian.</p> <p><b>Session 3: Serverless with Google Cloud - Bret McGowen (Google) <br/></b>From Functions-as-a-Service to Backend-as-a-Service, even Big Data-as-a-Service, Serverless is taking many different shapes. Learn what these mean and how Google Cloud Platform is building technology to make sure there's nothing standing between you and running your code. You'll see live demos of integration between Firebase, Cloud Functions, Cloud Pub/Sub (and even machine learning) to build autoscaling apps in record time - all without managing servers or application runtimes.</p> <p>Bret is on the Google Cloud Platform team at Google, focusing on serverless products like Google Cloud Functions, App Engine, Firebase, machine learning APIs, and more. He's currently an aspiring Node.js developer. Prior to Google, Bret worked in the cloud industry at Rackspace as a software engineer building the RackConnect hybrid hosting product. Before that, he led engineering teams at e-commerce and non-profits and tried his hand at creating two startups. He's often on the running trail, volleyball court or kickball field.</p> <p><b>Session 4: BigQuery and Tensorflow - Kaz Sato (Google) <br/></b>Kaz Sato is Staff Developer Advocate at Google Cloud team, Google Inc. Focusing on Machine Learning and Data Analytics products, such as TensorFlow, Cloud ML and BigQuery. Kaz has been speaking at major events including Google Cloud Next SF, Google I/O, Strata NYC etc., authoring many GCP blog posts, and leading developer communities for Google Cloud for over 8 years. He is also interested in hardwares and IoT, and has been hosting FPGA meetups since 2013.</p> <p><b>Q&amp;A discussion with Google Brisbane Team and Presenters </b></p> <p>Our event space is sponsored by Fishburners.
