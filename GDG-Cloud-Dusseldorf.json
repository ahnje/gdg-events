It will take place Wednesday, on the 27th of November, at InVision. We are happy to announce Bob van Luijt, Dr. Marco Bungart and Stefan Meyer-Kahlen as our speakers for the night!</p> <p>Bob will speak about building a knowledge graph on GCP</p> <p>Maybe you've heard of them before, knowledge graphs. But if you haven't, no worries, you are not alone. Knowledge graphs take an entirely new approach to data management. What makes them stand out from other data solutions is that they focus on the meaning and context of data by extracting the purpose of the language.</p> <p>The use cases are almost endless. It allows scientists to automate drug discovery, doctors to search for diseases based on patients' symptoms, to map our complex Internet of Things landscapes, gather insights from billions of financial transactions, and many more things.</p> <p>During this talk, we will go over the Weaviate software, the cloud deployment on Google Cloud Platform, and the use cases. Needless to say, they are all supported by on-stage demos. When the talk is over, you will be ready to start building your own Weaviate knowledge graph on Google Cloud Platform the very next day.</p> <p>Bob is the founder of SeMI Technologies, which is the business created around the open-source knowledge graph Weaviate. Besides SeMI and Weaviate. Bob is a frequent speaker on the topics of open source, digital technology, software business, and creativity. He has spoken at around 100+ events in Europe, the US, and Russia of which half as a Google Developer Expert.</p> <p>Marco will speak about Quarkus and how to start your java webapp as binary.</p> <p>The general availability of GraalVM allows Java developers to their programs to binary executables through the native-image. While this feature does not provide runtime improvements, it aims to<br/>- improve application startup time and<br/>- memory consumption</p> <p>Unfortunately, the native-image feature operates under a closed-world assumption, i.e. it disallows loading classes at runtime. This is particularly disappointing to Spring-framework users since Spring makes excessive use of dynamic class loading.</p> <p>The Quarkus project by Red Hat provides an embedded application server that is specifically trimmed to allow native-image compilation with GraalVM through some additional tooling at compilation time. Not only does this allow out-of-the-box support for generating native images, but it also improves the startup time of non-native Java webapps. Quarkus supports Jakarta and Microprofile, thus setting on community-driven standards.</p> <p>In this talk, we will take a look on how to use Quarkus and its features, as well as some culprits that are specific to native-image compilation.</p> <p>Dr. Marco Bungart is a Software Engineer at ConSol Consulting &amp; Solutions Software GmbH.</p> <p>Stefan will give an introduction to deep learning and its applications on computer chess.</p> <p>What is a deep neural network and why does it work so well?<br/>What can it be used for?<br/>What are the problems?<br/>Why does it have such huge effects in so many use cases?<br/>How can it be used in computer chess and why does it matter?<br/>Must mankind be afraid of the future?</p> <p>Stefan Meyer-Kahlen, author of the 19 times computer chess world champion Shredder (www.shredderchess.com), talks about the latest trends in machine learning.</p> <p>Our Agenda:<br/>18:00 - 19:30 - Dinner's ready<br/>19:30 - 20:15 - Build your own Knowledge Graph with Weaviate on GCP<br/>20:20 - 21:05 - Quarkus or how to execute your java webapp as binary - A demo in 8ms<br/>21:10 - 21:55 - Introduction to deep learning and its applications on computer chess</p> <p>Big thank you to our sponsor InVision that makes this awesome meetup possible!</p> <p>Cheers!<br/>GDG Cloud Düsseldorf</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1573133174000,"duration":14400000,"id":"266286686","name":"GDG Cloud Meetup January: IoT on the GCP, CI/CD with GitOps and Jenkins X","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1578589200000,"local_date":"2020-01-09","local_time":"18:00","updated":1578608879000,"utc_offset":3600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":86,"venue":{"id":26051720,"name":"InVision AG","lat":51.21432113647461,"lon":6.749450206756592,"repinned":true,"address_1":"Speditionstraße 5","city":"Düsseldorf","country":"de","localized_country_name":"Germany"},"group":{"created":1490184840000,"name":"GDG Cloud Düsseldorf","id":22970728,"join_mode":"open","lat":51.2400016784668,"lon":6.789999961853027,"urlname":"GDG-Cloud-Dusseldorf","who":"Members","localized_location":"Düsseldorf, Germany","state":"","country":"de","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Berlin"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Cloud-Dusseldorf/events/266286686/","description":"<p>Let’s get together for the first edition of the GDG Cloud Meetup DUS Meetup in 2020!</p> <p>We‘ll have three talks, covering two topics: IoT on the GCP and Continious Integration.</p> <p>Harald Fischer will be speaking about connecting real things to your GCP service landscape.</p> <p>Everyone is talking about the Internet of Things and the impact on our society and economics. But how to really integrate a **Thing** into your professional infrastructure? The Google Cloud Platform provides several tools for connecting and communicating with **Things** in your professional, service based google application landscape.</p> <p>At Livello we bring up smart fridges to live, connect them to cloud services and provide intelligent unattended retail platforms. Our applications and services are implemented, integrated and hosted in the GCP. We use the IoT Core to provision and manage secured communications with our **Things** that are fridges.<br/>Onboarding IoT devices is crucial to get them ready and running in your infrastructure. Google provides the IoT Core to manage, authenticate and integrate single IoT devices into the GCP.</p> <p>During this talk, we will go over the Google IoT Core, and the cases that Livello uses. Dynamic Provisioning, secured communication and configuration updates to name some of them. With Haralds talk you should be able to set up your IoT Core, connect your device to it and communicate with it, securely.</p> <p>Harald is head of product development at Livello and an embedded software developer and IoT architect by heart. His everyday business is the maintenance, development and provisioning of production and business ready IoT devices.</p> <p>Randy Gupta will be speaking about cloud native continous delivery with Jenkins X.</p> <p>In contrast to what it’s name might imply, Jenkins X is an entirely separate product build on and for kubernetes implementing GitOps for running serverless CI/CD pipelines using tekton. Jenkins X provides you out of the box with preview and staging environments.</p> <p>Randy will give an introduction to the concepts and will also speak about the work at SCARATEC with Jenkins X.</p> <p>Randy is CEO of SCARATEC, Google Developer Expert for Cloud and member of the GDG Cloud Düsseldorf organizer team.</p> <p>Robert will be speaking about the caveats of CI/CD. After the hype goes down and the tool for achieving \"Continuous anything\" you are faced with running the system, offering insights into how it operates through the observability tools available to you. You will have to make data driven decisions about where your time should be invested in the future and keeping a product focused mindset is imperious.<br/>Do you want to find out what it means to manage external dependencies like secrets sharing? Are you interested in how information offload needs to happen in order for developers to have a good experience when using CI/CD? How does your branching model affect your release cycle?<br/>Tune in as he will try to dive into the meat of the subject all while exemplifying using gitlab CI.</p> <p>Robert Tingirică is the engineering team lead working for epilot GmbH and a Cloud and Software engineer consultant.</p> <p>Our Agenda:<br/>18:00 - 18:30 - Dinner's ready<br/>18:30 - 19:15 - Connecting real things to your GCP service landscape, dynamically<br/>19:15 - 20:00 - Caveats of CI/CD<br/>20:00 - 20:45 - Cloud native CI/CD with GitOps and Jenkins X<br/>20:45 - 22:00 - Clubmate, Beer and great discussions...</p> <p>Big thank you to our sponsor InVision that makes this awesome meetup possible!</p> <p>Cheers!<br/>GDG Cloud Düsseldorf</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false}],"upcoming":[{"created":1573133229000,"duration":10800000,"id":"266286733","name":"GDG Cloud Meetup March: B2B Services on GCP + more","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"upcoming","time":1583427600000,"local_date":"2020-03-05","local_time":"18:00","updated":1579544752000,"utc_offset":3600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":20,"venue":{"id":26051720,"name":"InVision AG","lat":51.21432113647461,"lon":6.749450206756592,"repinned":true,"address_1":"Speditionstraße 5","city":"Düsseldorf","country":"de","localized_country_name":"Germany"},"group":{"created":1490184840000,"name":"GDG Cloud Düsseldorf","id":22970728,"join_mode":"open","lat":51.2400016784668,"lon":6.789999961853027,"urlname":"GDG-Cloud-Dusseldorf","who":"Members","localized_location":"Düsseldorf, Germany","state":"","country":"de","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Berlin"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Cloud-Dusseldorf/events/266286733/","description":"<p>We, at GDG Cloud Düsseldorf, are organizing our March meetup.

Connected accounts of customers, such as Google Analytics, should be integrated to exchange information automatically. A comprehensive usage of identity management (Identity Platform) and management of access rights (Firebase Custom Claims as well as IAM Policies) is required to bring such a service to production.</p> <p>Christiane and Florian both previously worked as IT-consultants and founded their startup “Riitail - Retail interaction information through artificial intelligence” beginning of 2020. Riitail brings the mechanisms of online marketing analytics to stationary retail. Therefore, optical AI sensors are used to detect interactions of customers with displayed products / advertisements / showrooms. B2B Services in the cloud collect and enrich the data before feeding the marketing analytic tools of customers (e.g. Google Analytics).</p> <p>The full schedule and more talks will be announced
