Firebase is app development platform that provides developers a variety of tools and a scalable infrastructure to build high quality apps. We’ll begin by showing how easy it is to read and write almost any data to Firebase and how to allow users to login, have data associated with them and send them notifications. We’ll learn how to use Firebase’s Security and Rules language to secure and add permissions to your data.</p> <p>Bring a laptop (PC, Mac or Chromebook). The labs will run on all of the latest versions of the popular browsers. For the best experience, make sure your laptop has Chrome or Firefox installed.
