A place where you can discover, learn or explore new things and technologies.</p> <p>You do not need to have any previous knowledge or you can be a hardware or software guru.</p> <p>You can bring your own project and discus it or continue its development. Or you can come and find out what that strange Arduino or RaspberryPi is all about.</p> <p>We have some robots which need some programming love. We have some lonely Arduinos and Raspberries which desire to be connected and plugged into a cute cool project. We have a (Open Hardware!) 3D printer which can give life to cases of your projects.</p> <p>We do not sell anything and entire IoT Garage is a non-profit effort meant to spread the knowledge about the wonderful world of Open Hardware and Internet of Things - while having great fun doing so.</p> <p>IoT Garage is organized by GDG Prague with the responsible organizer Tomáš Jukin (there is entire team behind the IoT Garage Prague, but when something is not right, Tom is here to be blamed :-D).
