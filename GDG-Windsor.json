Add on top of that the services offered by Google's Firebase tools and you can build mobile apps with all of the backend services you would expect in modern mobile apps - realtime databases, user authentication, push notifications, and A/B testing.</p> <p>For the past month, Don Ward has been digging into integrating Flutter apps with all of the Firebase services available as he partakes in the #100DaysofCode challenge. During this event, you will learn how to build mobile apps using Flutter backed with Firebase services and how they work with Flutter mobile apps. Some of the Firebase services we will cover include:</p> <p>1. Realtime Databases<br/>2. Firebase's Firestore Database<br/>3. Push Notifications on Firebase<br/>4. Mobile App Analytics<br/>5. Machine Learning services on Firebase (ML Kit)<br/>6. A/B testing for mobile apps<br/>7. Remote Config of your mobile app using Firebase<br/>8.
