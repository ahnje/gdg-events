Title: \"Retaining state between configuration changes in Android\" Abstract: Svetlin will describe the need to explicitly handle configuration changes in Android (e.g. a device orientation change). The framework-provided call back methods will be compared. Using a simple demo program, retaining state, using fragments, will be reviewed. Note: Basic knowledge about Android activity life-cycle will not be covered. Audience participation is welcome. Speaker: Erik Colban, Drametry Title: \"A Case against Finite State Machines\" Abstract: In this talk, Erik will go through different approaches; classical FSM approach, FSM using the State Pattern, using coroutines as an alternative to FSM and using threads as an alternative to FSM. He will highlight the pros and cons of each approach and illustrate each with a demo -- a small app where the user draws ellipses and polylines on a window pane.</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1319678917000,"id":"38874562","name":"First Formal Meetup!","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1321495200000,"local_date":"2011-11-16","local_time":"18:00","updated":1324523204000,"utc_offset":-28800000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":52,"venue":{"id":4165182,"name":"Bridgepoint Education Inc","lat":32.96284866333008,"lon":-117.09439849853516,"repinned":false,"address_1":"13500 Evening Creek Dr N","city":"San Diego","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"92128","state":"CA"},"group":{"created":1261342493000,"name":"GDG San Diego - Android Developers Group","id":1571509,"join_mode":"open","lat":32.88999938964844,"lon":-117.19999694824219,"urlname":"Android-Developers-Group","who":"Members","localized_location":"San Diego, CA","state":"CA","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Pacific"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/Android-Developers-Group/events/38874562/","manual_attendance_count":50,"description":"<p> </p> <p> </p> <p><a href=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/0/2/e/event_63525102.jpegI'm\" class=\"linkified\">http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/0/2/e/event_63525102.jpegI'm</a> happy to announce that our first formal meetup will take place on <b>Wednesday, November 16</b> at the <b>Bridgepoint Education</b> offices in North County near the 15-56 interchange!</p> <p>Some of you have been to our two previous informal meetups at Karl Strauss.

He started using Linux in college in the late 90's and has more than a few lines of code in the USB stacks and drivers as well as many consumer devices from iPods to TVs to navigation systems. After a sabbatical in 2009 to climb Mt. Everest, he returned to engineering contracting until the summer of 2011. He has a keen interest in Android and Google's 'release first and iterate fast' designs and was hired at ARM as a developer evangelist to both improve ARM's tools, libraries and compiler technologies as they relate to Android internally and to solicit developer input from independent applications developers as well as major device manufacturers. He is very interested to hear what developers consider as a priority to get the best performance and user experience from ARM powered devices and is happy to share some of the tools and projects ARM has been working on.</p> <p> </p> <p>Our second speaker is <b>David Sainte-Claire</b>, who heads up the San Diego Google Technology Users Group (SD-GTUG).  David will be presenting to us on developing Android user interfaces using Fragments.

They wrote a message in a cryptic language, and next to it they wrote a series of symbols. We've come to the conclusion that the symbols indicate a number: the number of seconds before war begins!</p> <p>Unfortunately we have no idea what each symbol means. We've decided that each symbol indicates one digit, but we aren't sure what each digit means or what base the aliens are using. For example, if they wrote \"ab2ac999\", they could have meant \"[masked]\" in base 10 -- exactly one year -- or they could have meant \"[masked]\" in base 6 --[masked] seconds, or about four and a half days. We are sure of three things: the number is positive; like us, the aliens will never start a number with a zero; and they aren't using unary (base 1).</p> <p>Your job is to determine the minimum possible number of seconds before war begins.</p> <p>Input</p> <p>The first line of input contains a single integer, <b>T</b>. <b>T</b> test cases follow. Each test case is a string on a line by itself. The line will contain only characters in the 'a' to 'z' and '0' to '9' ranges (with no spaces and no punctuation), representing the message the aliens left us. The test cases are independent, and can be in different bases with the symbols meaning different things.</p> <p>Output</p> <p>For each test case, output a line in the following format:</p> <p>Case #<b> X</b>: <b> V</b> Where <b>X</b> is the case number (starting from 1) and <b>V</b> is the minimum number of seconds before war begins.</p> <p>Limits</p> <p>1 ≤ <b>T</b> ≤ 100<br/>The answer will never exceed 1018</p> <p>Small dataset</p> <p>1 ≤ the length of each line &lt; 10</p> <p>Large dataset</p> <p>1 ≤ the length of each line &lt; 61</p> <p>Sample</p> <p>Input </p> <p>Output <br/>3<br/>[masked]<br/>cats<br/>zig<br/>Case #1: 201<br/>Case #2: 75<br/>Case #3: 11  </p> <p> </p> ","how_to_find_us":"There will be a sign on the door","visibility":"public"},{"created":1338834167000,"duration":7200000,"id":"67705422","name":"Countdown to CodeFest Meetup","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1339639200000,"local_date":"2012-06-13","local_time":"19:00","updated":1339692949000,"utc_offset":-25200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":11,"venue":{"id":5901272,"name":"Digitaria Interactive Inc","lat":32.7088508605957,"lon":-117.15579986572266,"repinned":false,"address_1":"350 10th Ave # 1200","city":"San Diego","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"92101","state":"CA"},"group":{"created":1261342493000,"name":"GDG San Diego - Android Developers Group","id":1571509,"join_mode":"open","lat":32.88999938964844,"lon":-117.19999694824219,"urlname":"Android-Developers-Group","who":"Members","localized_location":"San Diego, CA","state":"CA","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Pacific"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/Android-Developers-Group/events/67705422/","manual_attendance_count":30,"description":"<p>Countdown to CodeFest Meetup</p> <p>Wednesday, June 13, 2012</p> <p>7:00 – 9:00PM</p> <p>Digitaria<br/>350 10th Avenue #1200, San Diego, CA 92101</p> <p>Come enjoy a special event kicking off the countdown to CodeFest 2012.</p> <p>Technology experts will be sharing their insights on the latest trends in peer-to-peer, HTML5, and contextually aware mobile apps.

The table stands up vertically so that pieces drop down to the bottom-most empty slots in their column. For example, consider the following two configurations:</p> <p>    <b> - Legal Position -</b>             .......           .......           .......           ....R..           ...RB..           ..BRB..           .RBBR..    <b> - Illegal Position -</b>             .......           .......           .......           .......    Bad -&gt; ..BR...           ...R...           .RBBR.. In these pictures, each '.' represents an empty slot, each 'R' represents a slot filled with a red piece, and each 'B' represents a slot filled with a blue piece. The left configuration is legal, but the right one is not. This is because one of the pieces in the third column (marked with the arrow) has not fallen down to the empty slot below it.</p> <p>A player wins if they can place at least <b>K</b> pieces of their color in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The four possible orientations are shown below:</p> <p>      <b> - Four in a row -</b>        R   RRRR    R   R      R          R     R      R         R       R      R        R         R In the \"Legal Position\" diagram at the beginning of the problem statement, both players had lined up two pieces in a row, but not three.</p> <p>As it turns out, you are right now playing a very exciting game of Join-<b>K</b>, and you have a tricky plan to ensure victory! When your opponent is not looking, you are going to rotate the board 90 degrees clockwise onto its side. Gravity will then cause the pieces to fall down into a new position as shown below:</p> <p>    <b> - Start -</b>        .......      .......      .......      ...R...      ...RB..      ..BRB..      .RBBR..    <b> - Rotate -</b>       .......      R......      BB.....      BRRR...      RBB....      .......      .......    <b> - Gravity -</b>        .......      .......      .......      R......      BB.....      BRR....      RBBR... Unfortunately, you only have time to rotate once before your opponent will notice.</p> <p>All that remains is picking the right time to make your move. Given a board position, you should determine which player (or players!) will have <b>K</b> pieces in a row after you rotate the board clockwise and gravity takes effect in the new direction.</p> <p>Notes</p> <p>You can rotate the board only once. Assume that gravity only takes effect after the board has been rotated completely.

Instead of users requesting (pulling) data from servers and services, information is pushed to users' mobile devices, just at the right time. These push notifications can even be actionable, i.e. allowing a direct response. However, if they arrive on wearable device, like a smart watch, a user can only use gestures and voice to interact.</p> <p>You don't have to put you ear on the ground, and still, can literally hear it coming. The broad introduction of Voice User Interfaces. I will cover some basic speech recognition ideas and how to implement them on mobile devices, will give an overview of how push notifications work and what it takes to implement them in Java on the server side (Push) in an Android mobile app (Receive), and give an overview of Android Wear, how it works and what you can do with it.</p> <p>You will get glimpse of what could be the next big thing in UX and how it all fits together.</p> <p>Bio: ‎Wolf Paulus is a photographer, hiker, hacker, technologist based in Ramona, California.

so far:</b></p> <p> #1) One developers investigation results: The few hacky tricks I had in mind will not work. This shows how the Android RIL PDK is organized:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.netmite.com/android/mydroid/development/pdk/docs/telephony.html\"><a href=\"http://www.netmite.com/android/mydroid/development/pdk/docs/telephony.html\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.netmite.com/android/mydroid/development/pdk/docs/telephony.html</a></a></p> <p> Essentially explaining why this is all you can access publically:</p> <p><a href=\"http://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/package-summary.html\"><a href=\"http://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/package-summary.html\" class=\"linkified\">http://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/package-summary.html</a></a></p> <p> My explanation:  when you pick up a phone call the microphone is routed directly to a codec connected to the baseband via </p> <p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SLIMbus\">SlimBus</a></p> <p>.  There is no way to communicate with it in </p> <p><a href=\"https://source.android.com/\">AOSP</a></p> <p>. There is a rooted solution, but that is equivalent to no solution in my opinion and would be worth far more than this bounty to develop (requires some heavy kernel mods and AOSP mods) and even then might be rejected by the baseband codec as these are very time sensitive.  I've done some mods like this before, the end result will be that it works on one device type and that is it.  Some of Qualcomm's chipsets allow audio injection and support an API for it but this would require rooting as well. We discussed a custom dialer app.  You will still be at the mercy of the vendors firmware, so all the above issues would still exist, solving nothing. I don't consider a solution that plays audio out the speaker phone at a high enough volume to be picked up by the mic a valid solution.  I've played with apps that do that and it is flaky at best.  Add in existence of headsets, different fidelity of mics/speakers, different acoustic echo cancellation and this solution will never be a general one.  The best version of this method I could come up with was requiring the user to have a Bluetooth headset, then place it on the phone and have the phone start pumping out music.  I figured this would be best because you can physically place the Bluetooth headset mic on your phones speaker giving the best chance of clear transfer. A few solutions can be derived if you allow each end point to call into an external system which routes the call together.  At that point you have full control over the audio stream between both ends.  This solution doesn't sound ideal for your end game but if you are interested in exploring it let me know. “(CORRECT WE ARE ALREADY AWARE OF THIS OPTION HOWEVER IT IS NOT IDEAL, WE WANT THE APP TO PLAY THE MESSAGE WITOUT A 3RDPARTY)” Sorry!  Hope my explanations help in your search.  I'd love to hear if anyone can solve it in a legit generic non-rooted manner.  #2) Discussion from posting the question on Google + Android Developers Group: </p> <p><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/102869747506084742284\">Andre Doucette</a></p> <p>Hi! We're trying to build an IVR-like system, which will provide verbal instructions to the other side of a phone call. The problem we're having is in playing the verbal instructions (a pre-recorded sound file) on the outgoing audio stream so that the other person is able to hear it. There seems to be no standard way of doing this, but has anyone found ways to accomplish this? Are there any libraries we can use? What about replacing the dialer, or dropping to JNI-land?﻿ </p> <p><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/110659467084349972943\">Boardies IT Solutions</a></p> <p> There are services that do this such as Aculab Cloud and Twilio are the ones I know of but there are several available. I personally use Twilio has a simple and straight forward api and is pretty good value for money. ﻿</p> <p><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/102869747506084742284\">Andre Doucette</a></p> <p>Twilio is excellent. We've used it for other projects as well. The issue is that we want this to work without having the call to originate at a server phone number. That is, we want this to work on a regular cell-to-cell phone call, and then our app will take over the call. I believe Twilio would only work if the original phone call was to a Twilio number. Is there a way to \"hand off\" an existing call to Twilio?﻿ Boardies IT SolutionsNot that I know of. The only way I can think of doing this would be if phone a does the outbound call as normal. You listen for a phone state change listener to say that the outbound call has been answered and then cell a plays an audio file, file being embedded into the app. The only thing i'm not sure of though is whether the android API allows an audio file to be played through to a call. </p> <p>The only other way is that phone a outdials to twilio and the twilio outdials to phone b passing the CLI of phone a, although this would require twilio having phone a CLI as a verified number which I guess there could be lots of CLIs you're calling from so this may not be suitable. Hope this helps though. ﻿ </p> <p><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/102869747506084742284\">Andre Doucette</a></p> <p>Our attempts to play an audio file on the outgoing stream has so far been unsuccessful. It seems there is no obvious/standard way to do this. What about replacing the dialer? Would that give us access to underlying APIs we can't as a regular app?﻿ </p> <p><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/110659467084349972943\">Boardies IT Solutions</a></p> <p>I don't think so, if its available in the API then you should be able to do it, replacing the dialer won't give you any extra API as to make a different dialer, you'll still be using the same public API to create the dialer if you see what I mean. From having a quick Google it doesn't look as if the android API supports sending an audio stream through the call. The only alternative would be to play the audio file loud enough so that the microphone can pick up the audio but quality would be probably be very poor and you'd have little control over the volume as different devices may pick up the audio better than others.﻿</p> ","how_to_find_us":"No Location","visibility":"public"},{"created":1453333244000,"duration":10800000,"id":"228240158","name":"Using the new Fingerprint API in your app","rsvp_limit":30,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1455154200000,"local_date":"2016-02-10","local_time":"17:30","updated":1455166589000,"utc_offset":-28800000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":30,"venue":{"id":20472952,"name":"TEK Systems","lat":32.87208938598633,"lon":-117.21672821044922,"repinned":false,"address_1":"4180 La Jolla Village Dr Ste 100","city":"La Jolla","country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA"},"group":{"created":1261342493000,"name":"GDG San Diego - Android Developers Group","id":1571509,"join_mode":"open","lat":32.88999938964844,"lon":-117.19999694824219,"urlname":"Android-Developers-Group","who":"Members","localized_location":"San Diego, CA","state":"CA","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Pacific"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/Android-Developers-Group/events/228240158/","description":"<p>In the latest version of Android (Marshmallow) Google released a new API to allow developers to authenticate users using their fingerprints.  We will go over what you can and cannot do with these new APIs.  We will also look at some sample projects that I've created to see how you can integrate the Fingerprint API into your app.</p> <p>Food and drinks will be provided by our wonderful hosts, TekSystems.</p> <p>Due to our new location, we can only have 20 attendees.  So RSVP early or else you might be put on the Meet-Up wait list.</p> <p>Park in the underground garage.  TEKSystems will validate your parking ticket.</p> <p>Agenda:</p> <p>5:30 -  food/networking</p> <p>6:00 - housekeeping</p> <p>6:10 - Derek Davis tax app demo</p> <p>6:25 - Bryan's presentation</p> <p>8:00ish - wrapup</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1457555151000,"id":"229468207","name":"Network Explorer app pitfalls and patterns","rsvp_limit":30,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1458779400000,"local_date":"2016-03-23","local_time":"17:30","updated":1458835149000,"utc_offset":-25200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":30,"venue":{"id":20472952,"name":"TEK Systems","lat":32.87208938598633,"lon":-117.21672821044922,"repinned":false,"address_1":"4180 La Jolla Village Dr Ste 100","city":"La Jolla","country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA"},"group":{"created":1261342493000,"name":"GDG San Diego - Android Developers Group","id":1571509,"join_mode":"open","lat":32.88999938964844,"lon":-117.19999694824219,"urlname":"Android-Developers-Group","who":"Members","localized_location":"San Diego, CA","state":"CA","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Pacific"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/Android-Developers-Group/events/229468207/","description":"<p>For this meeting, I (your co-organizer Bill Wixted) will present an app that I recently developed for fun.  </p> <p>It's called <b>Network Explorer</b>.  You can find it in the <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.effinitytech.networkexplorer\">Google Play Store</a>.</p> <p>This is a version 1.0 so I'd appreciate any feedback you have.</p> <p>I will talk about some of the pitfalls and challenges I ran into during development.  I'll also discuss some of the design patterns I used and networking code I developed for it.  Topics I will touch on:</p> <p>• fragments, action bar, navigation drawer</p> <p>• Wi-Fi network discovery</p> <p>• Bluetooth device discovery</p> <p>• Discovering devices connected to a Wi-Fi network</p> <p>• Integrating ACRA and Google Analytics</p> <p>The awesome people at <b><a href=\"https://www.teksystems.com/en\">TEKSystems</a> </b>will once again be hosting us.  Thank you Emily Bartram and Ryan Costigan!</p> <p>Agenda:</p> <p>5:30 -  food/networking</p> <p>6:00 - housekeeping</p> <p>6:10 - Bill presents Network Explorer</p> <p>8:00ish - wrapup</p> ","how_to_find_us":"Park in the underground garage.

Our imagination has been fed by science fiction, movies, cartons. But where are the robots to be seen today? You might wonder.<br/>At Aldebaran, we’ve been making robots for the last 10 years. Programmable humanoid robots. Social robots. Robots that don’t focus on performance but rather on interacting with people. We get the feeling they are the ultimate interface.

This session shows you how to develop mobile applications with Java and JavaFX and deploy them on IOS and Android devices, all from the same code base. The session begins with an overview of JavaFX UI controls and property binding techniques. After demonstrating an example JavaFX application with FXML, Scene Builder, and Gluon Maps, you’ll learn how to deploy the app on a mobile device (IOS or Android). You’ll also learn how to keep connected mobile devices updated when data in the cloud changes. This session includes several useful examples and shows how Java and JavaFX makes it easy to develop applications that target different mobile devices. This write once, run anywhere (WORA) platform uses an IDE plug in and library support from Gluon to create native applications.</p> <p>Speaker Bios: Paul Anderson is the Director of Training and founding member of the Anderson Software Group.

AWS Mobile Hub lets you easily add and configure features for your mobile apps, including user authentication, data storage, APIs and backend logic, push notifications, intelligent bots, content delivery, and analytics. Whether you are creating a brand new mobile app or adding features to an existing app, AWS Mobile Hub lets you leverage the features, scalability, reliability, and low cost of AWS in minutes. AWS Mobile Hub walks you through feature selection and configuration, automatically provisions the AWS services required to power these features, and generates working apps for iOS and Android that use your provisioned services. <br/> <br/>You can then test your app on the same devices your customers use and run tests across a large selection of physical devices. Unlike emulators, physical devices provide a more accurate understanding of how users interact with your app by taking into account factors such as memory, CPU usage, location, and modifications done by manufactures and carriers to the firmware and software.</p> <p>In this session, we will demo how to create a mobile app with AWS Mobile Hub and integrate the features with various AWS Services, and test the app using AWS Device Farm. </p> <p>Speaker Bio: Rohan Deshpande is a Senior Engineer with Amazon Web Services. He is the technical owner of the Amazon Mobile Push/SMS/Email channels, AWS Device Farm, Amazon Pinpoint, AWS Mobile Hub, and the AWS SDK for React Native. He is passionate about the mobile developer experience, automation, intelligent interfaces, and serverless cloud computing.</p> <p><b>Maps — the original big data problem (literally).  Maps — the original data visualization solution.</b></p> <p><b>by Rob Chohan, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/title/mobile-architect?trk=mprofile_title\">Mobile Architect</a>, e<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/vsearch/p?company=ePi+Rational%2C+Inc%2E&amp;trk=prof-exp-company-name\">Pi Rational, Inc.</a></b></p> <p>Summary: No matter how you describe a map, it is probably one of the top ten used apps on your mobile device. Consider how much land or square kilometers a paper map covers.  Add in a mobile device and GPS receiver, and a location that has no data signal and you have solid compelling product for traversing the back country with a mobile map.  The talk will focus around making a back country hiking map for iOS and Android based on US Forest Service maps that are freely available.  </p> <p>This talk is about the power of maps for mobile.  Rob will discuss the data wrangling and image processing of making a map for mobile using open source technologies such as Mapbox, GDAL, GeoJSON, and WEBP. </p> <p>For a quick intro on the product check out: <a href=\"http://roblabs.com/MtW\"><a href=\"http://RobLabs.com/MtW\" class=\"linkified\">http://RobLabs.com/MtW</a></a></p> <p>Speaker Bio: Rob Chohan loves maps.  Rob is taking his background in statistics, image processing, mobile imaging, and printing to create innovations in maps for mobile.  Rob currently works for ePi Rational, Inc., a San Diego based startup creating innovations in cartography, data visualization, mobile, and geoinformatics.  ePi focuses on 'data wrangling' to tell a story about a location.
