Less talking and more doing, we decided to have a much more practical session than with the last Flutter-themed meetup we hosted.<br/>In the Flutter hands-on session, Dan will help us get our feet wet with Flutter by building our (first?) own Flutter app. You don't have to have any experience with Flutter (although that also doesn't hurt), but it would be great if you came with a (simple) idea in mind what you want to build (and a laptop, preferably with a Flutter setup prepared, but don't worry if you don't). We'll have drinks and food and build something, together or by ourselves, and have a good time with code and material pleasures.<br/>Hope to see many of you on Friday, the 13th!<br/>If anyone wants to provide their (company) space, we would be happy to have a co-host, if not, we will find a space to host ourselves.</p> ","how_to_find_us":"We will be at Easy APIOMAT GmbH in the City Center.
