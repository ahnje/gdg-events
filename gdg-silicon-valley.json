WebGL brings 3D graphics to the Web by introducing an API that closely conforms to OpenGL ES 2.0 that can be used in HTML5 canvas elements. Find out more about WebGL, what it is and what it can do through examples and demos.</p> <p>Our presenter will be Gregg Tavares, who wrote most of the excellent<br/><a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/webglsamples/\"><a href=\"http://code.google.co\" class=\"linkified\">http://code.google.co</a>...</a></p> <p>Gregg has been in the video game industry for most of his life with shipping games from Apple II, Atari 800, C64 days up to PS3 and Xbox 360. He is now on the Chrome GPU team helping to bring WebGL and GPU acceleration to Chrome.</p> <p>From the WebGL Wiki:</p> <p>The immediate mode nature of the API is a divergence from most web APIs. Given the many use cases of 3D graphics, WebGL chooses the approach of providing flexible primitives that can be applied to any use case. Libraries can provide an API on top of WebGL that is more tailored to specific areas, thus adding a convenience layer to WebGL that can accelerate and simplify development. However, because of its OpenGL ES 2.0 heritage, it should be straightforward for developers familiar with modern desktop OpenGL or OpenGL ES 2.0 development to transition to WebGL development.</p> <p><b>Agenda</b></p> <p>* 6:00-7:00pm Dinner and Networking<br/>* 7:00-7:30pm Lightning talks<br/>* 7:30-8:30pm Gregg Tavares, WebGL<br/>* 8:30-9:00pm Q&amp;A</p> ","how_to_find_us":"Kevin and Tom are usually by the podium during the networking hour.","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1298341065000,"id":"16654146","name":"Flash on Android by Steve Chin and Andre Kruetzfeldt","rsvp_limit":250,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1299117600000,"local_date":"2011-03-02","local_time":"18:00","updated":1302142891000,"utc_offset":-28800000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":250,"group":{"created":1234470551000,"name":"Google Developer Group Silicon Valley","id":1381929,"join_mode":"open","lat":37.40999984741211,"lon":-122.08000183105469,"urlname":"gdg-silicon-valley","who":"Google Developers","localized_location":"Mountain View, CA","state":"CA","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Pacific"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdg-silicon-valley/events/16654146/","description":"<p><b>Adgenda</b></p> <p>6:00 - 6:45 Networking &amp; Food</p> <p>6:45 - 7:00 Lightning Demo (Kevin Nilson, ...)</p> <p>7:00 - 7:15 Intro and Announcements</p> <p>7:15 - 7:45 Andre Kruetzfeldt</p> <p>7:45 - 8:45 Steve Chin</p> <p> </p> <p><b>Description</b></p> <p> </p> <p>Tonight we will go over the boarder.

In contrast to Javascript libraries and browser-plugin based solutions, it features a robust server-side architecture. This means that the largest part of the application logic runs securely on the server. Google Web Toolkit (GWT) is used on the browser side to ensure a rich and fluent user experience.</p> <p><b>Vaadin</b> is a large collection of UI components. You compose the application user interface from components such as Buttons, Tables, Trees and Layouts. The components use events, listeners and data binding to communicate with each other and with your business logic.</p> <p><b>Vaadin</b> is a robust architecture for rapid application development. The component-based architecture together with statically typed Java language and data binding features help you build applications that are easily modularized and refactored as needed. The IDE and tooling support including visual designing tool help you to build web user interface extremely fast.</p> <p> </p> <p><b>Jani Laakso</b> has been programming since the early demoscene in the mid 80s.

BigQuery enables developers to analyze terabyte data sets in seconds using a RESTful API and a SQL-like query language. We'll demonstrate how you can incorporate Google BigQuery into your own applications, and how queries are processed underneath the covers.  We’ll also show examples using public data sets and demos built by other developers like you.</p> <p><b>Ryan Boyd</b> is a Developer Advocate at Google, focused on cloud data services such as Google BigQuery. He’s been in the Developer Relations group for 5 years and previously helped build out the Google Apps ISV ecosystem. Ryan recently published his first book on “Getting Started with OAuth 2.0” with O’Reilly.</p> <p><b>Introducing Apache Drill</b></p> <p>Apache Drill is a new open source Apache Incubator project for interactive analysis of large-scale datasets, inspired by Google's Dremel. It enables users to query terabytes of data in seconds. Apache Drill supports a broad range of data formats, including Protocol Buffers, Avro and JSON, and leverages Hadoop and HBase as data sources. Drill's primary query language, DrQL, is compatible with Google BigQuery.

Attendees may be evaluating cloud technologies and doing due diligence to determine which solution(s) are right for their organizations. Knowledge of Web development and client-server computing may be helpful but are not required.</p> <p><b>Abstract:</b></p> <p>Google App Engine is an exciting development and cloud-hosting platform that lets you build &amp; deploy web (and non-web) applications on Google's scalable high-traffic infrastructure using familiar development environments. App Engine apps execute on servers in Google data centers and use the same technology that powers Google's websites for speed, scalability, and reliability.

Nowadays we have multiple computers in our homes, yet robots have classically been optimized for speed and precision in industrial environments. Vacuum cleaning or lawn mowing robots however indicate the beginning of a new trend: service robots in shared environments with humans. The miniaturization and cost-effective production of range and localization sensors on the one hand and the ever increasing compute power of modern processors on the other, enable the creation of smart and sensing robots for domestic use cases. - This talk will give an introduction to robotics and cover constraints in domestic environments. Furthermore we will address how you can start exploring advanced robotics in your home.</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/1/7/c/600_376649052.jpeg\" /></p> <p>Bio: </p> <p>Martin Wojtczyk is an award-winning software engineer and the founder of Cubotix <a href=\"http://www.cubotix.com/\"><a href=\"http://www.cubotix.com\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.cubotix.com</a></a> - a DIY community creating smart and affordable service robots for everybody.

He won multiple awards in global programming competitions and was recently recognized as an Intel Software Innovator.</p> <p>Is Thought the Future of Mobile Input?</p> <p>The Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a mainstay of science fiction, but devices are appearing today to use our brainwaves as a computer input. Is it practical? How far away is it? What sort of input is possible and where is it being used?<br/>We will look at the roots of the technologies that allow a view of the inner functions of the human mind, as well as the possibilities for direct input to, and augmentation of the mind, perception and thought processes. The process includes real-world examples and a demonstration with volunteers controlling software and hardware with only their thoughts and feelings. Gain an understanding of how this still evolving and largely unknown technology really works, how it can be used, and its longer-term implications.</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/2/8/a/600_376649322.jpeg\" /></p> <p>Bio:</p> <p>As lead developer evangelist at Embarcadero Technologies, Jim is a key part of Embarcadero’s evangelism team and developer community outreach.

After four months spent cycling across Africa he returned to London to join a major investment bank and then Last.fm as a Data Engineer. Last year his interest in robotics brought him to UC Berkeley, where he completed a Master of Engineering degree with a focus on distributed computing and unmanned aerial vehicles, working in his spare time on an UAV startup. After leaving Cal, he joined Mesosphere as a Distributed Applications Engineer and is currently working on easy deployment of Mesosphere clusters on Google Cloud Platform.</p> <p>&lt;a href=\"https://gist.github.com/ssk2/ee248323c21b48f9736e#abstract\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; <b>Abstract: </b>Gone are the days where you could build an app that only needs to run on a few servers. Now every app needs to be like Google: highly-distributed, fast, scalable and fault-tolerant. Devops everywhere spend a lot of time building their own custom scale-out architectures for web apps, but this is no longer necessary thanks to Mesosphere. Mesosphere's Marathon is an open source framework built on Apache Mesos that automates operations and provides a simple self-serve interface for developers to launch their apps on a shared cluster in a scalable and fault-tolerant way.

It's used extensively to manipulate the DOM, do simple client-side validation, and make AJAX calls. JavaScript then escaped the browser and became available server-side development via Node.js. This is yet another place you'll find JavaScript: in Google's cloud. No, we're not talking about the Google Cloud Platform (although) you can also reach those components from our tool. I'm talking about Google Apps Script.</p> <p>Apps Script gives developers programmatic access to data in Google Apps as well as other Google services. Users can manipulate data, automate tasks, extend functionality of Google Apps products like Docs &amp; Sheets, and can communicate with other online apps or databases.</p> <p>This session provides a high-level overview of Google Apps Script, some background, a gentle introduction, various use cases, and walk though several scripts to show you different things that you can accomplish using Apps Script. Time-permitting, we'll also cover recent product updates. Knowledge of JavaScript may be useful but not required.</p> <p><img src=\"http://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/authors/c/chun_wesley/chun_wesley_c.jpg\" /></p> <p>Bio: <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/+WesleyChun\">+WESLEY CHUN</a>, MSCS, is author of Prentice Hall's bestselling \"Core Python\" series (<a href=\"http://corepython.com/\">corepython.com</a>), the \"Python Fundamentals\" companion videos, co-author of \"Python Web Development with Django\" (<a href=\"http://withdjango.com/\">withdjango.com</a>), and has written for Linux Journal, CNET, and InformIT.

Google’s reCAPTCHA is the largest CAPTCHA service in the world. With the shift to mobile, there is an increasing need to fight spam in that space. However, traditional CAPTCHAs are not well suited for mobile form factors. In response, the reCAPTCHA team recently launched a completely reimagined API that lets users pass the CAPTCHA test with just a single click. This “No CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA” dramatically simplifies the mobile user experience. In this talk we will discuss the technology behind the magic “No CAPTCHA” followed by spam stats observed by reCAPTCHA over the internet.</p> <p><b>BIO: </b>Ying Liu is a software engineering manager at Google.

Everyone wants to play with the cool new toys, but experienced developers know that once you have a customer base and you need to provide support and maintenance, breaking changes are a challenge that might come at a high cost. During this talk, we’ll show you how to utilize Web Components and Polymer to start migrating the server side JSF UI to the client in an Enterprise Content Management Platform. We’ll also provide an overview of the technical challenges of leveraging custom elements to build interoperable UI components for the web. We will also review how Web Components are providing concepts surprisingly similar to what is supplied by JSF along with a highly interoperable component-based client side framework that leverages the DOM as the “framework” and HTML as its familiar declarative syntax.</p> <p>Key Takeaways:</p> <p>• Differences but also surprising similarities between JSF2 and Web Components <br/>• Technical obstacles and a new way of solving these issues <br/>• Migration strategies to switch to the new stack </p> <p><b>Bio: </b>Vladimir has joined Nuxeo in 2011 as a Software Engineer in the Nuxeo Development team in Paris. As part of the development team of the Nuxeo Platform, Vladimir has worked on core projects of the software like the global REST API, Automation and Workflow engine. More recently he’s been working on the migration of Nuxeo UI from JSF to Polymer.</p> <p><b>Thinking in Polymer (Data) Components: </b>Polymer makes it really easy to encapsulate discrete UI as reusable Web Components. But an app with just an interface is not especially useful. What if we could use the same approach to encapsulate discrete API as reusable Web Components? In this talk, we'll walk through what it takes to express a RESTful API resource as a Polymer Web Component. We will also review the benefits gained from being able to think of API resources in terms of components. We will also discuss how to hygienically test data components. Finally, I'll review data components that the Polymer team has already built for you to leverage in your application today.<b><br/></b></p> <p><b>Bio: </b>Chris Joel is a software engineer at Google working on Polymer Elements.

So how do you keep track of what you want to use and what you’ve deployed? Following the principles of “Immutable Infrastructure”, Terraform allows you to keep track of which resources are deployed, and to plan out your deployments based on dependencies. When your deployment needs change, Terraform helps you to iterate on your existing plan and deploy new resources. We will discuss Terraform’s application to the GCP space, and how you can use it to manage your resources within the Google ecosystem.</p> <p><b>Tim Fall</b> is Chief Solutions Architect at HashiCorp.

We struggle with overriding styles, high specificity, redundant CSS, just to mention a few. So how do we build a reusable pattern library that cuts down CSS size, reduces complexity for the browser, offers consistency to our products, and enables accessibility?</p> <p>Let’s dive deep into building every UI element of our pattern library with consistency, accessibility and performance baked in. We will wrap it in a style guide using PostCSS for ease of reusability. We will also look at CSS analysis and monitoring tools for maintaining the style guide through the lifecycle of the product.</p> <p><b>Title: NgRx: How Angular does Redux</b></p> <p><b>Speaker:</b> Jeff Cros, nrwl.io</p> <p><b>Brief:</b> Coming soon.</p> <p>//</p> <p><b>Schedule</b></p> <p>630 - 700 - Registration</p> <p>700 - 715 - Welcome </p> <p>715 - 740 - WebAssembly, Demystified</p> <p>740 - 805 - Building a CSS Style Guide</p> <p>805 - 820 - Angular Jeopardy</p> <p>820 - 845 - NgRx: How Angular does Redux</p> <p>845 - 900 - Angular Panel</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1499664166000,"id":"241539676","name":"Google Smart Home API","rsvp_limit":350,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1507165200000,"local_date":"2017-10-04","local_time":"18:00","updated":1507656081000,"utc_offset":-25200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":350,"group":{"created":1234470551000,"name":"Google Developer Group Silicon Valley","id":1381929,"join_mode":"open","lat":37.40999984741211,"lon":-122.08000183105469,"urlname":"gdg-silicon-valley","who":"Google Developers","localized_location":"Mountain View, CA","state":"CA","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Pacific"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdg-silicon-valley/events/241539676/","manual_attendance_count":150,"description":"<p>BADGING/RSVP POLICY</p> <p>Please help us with badging and sign-up for this Meetup with your first and last name by answering the question during RSVP.

How to provide consistent design and experience across many applications? How to avoid solving the same problems many times across teams? How to efficiently verify that shared libraries and apps work together as both are evolving? Nx (Nrwl Extensions for Angular) solves these challenges and more by encouraging teams to keep many applications and shared libraries in the same repository, or a \"monorepo.\" Jeff Cross from Nrwl (nrwl.io) will specifically discuss why the monorepo approach makes sense for large teams, and what Nx does to help teams organize their code in this fashion.</p> <p>Speaker: Matias Niemala, Angular Core Team, Google<br/>Title: Animate all the things</p> <p>Talk:<br/>Watch Matias do some live coding and learn how to build parts of the flagship Angular animation website (<a href=\"http://animationsftw.in\" class=\"linkified\">http://animationsftw.in</a>).</p> <p>Speaker: Nathan Walker, Co-Founder, nStudio.io<br/>Title: Balance and Harmony with Angular and NativeScript</p> <p>Talk:<br/>\"Metal\" from our computers and devices is one of the 5 essential elements of Feng Shui and it surrounds us everywhere we go. Although the user interface on these devices is not often considered an element of this analysis, color certainly is and an experience with these devices can certainly affect our immediate environment (and mood!). Let's discuss how bringing together Angular and NativeScript can help achieve balance and harmony between the web and mobile spaces which affect our everyday lives. Nathan Walker from nStudio (Tracy - I will provide a website link when it is complete by end of next week) has been experimenting with these 2 technologies since they first emerged and has gone on to create several successful products with them. Along the way, we'll learn some tips and best practices when using them together as well in an Nx workspace (spoiler alert!).</p> <p>More info coming soon!</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1519347728000,"duration":10800000,"id":"248079012","name":"The Creative Technologist and Kubernetes Cluster, what's next?","rsvp_limit":300,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1520474400000,"local_date":"2018-03-07","local_time":"18:00","updated":1521512302000,"utc_offset":-28800000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":300,"group":{"created":1234470551000,"name":"Google Developer Group Silicon Valley","id":1381929,"join_mode":"open","lat":37.40999984741211,"lon":-122.08000183105469,"urlname":"gdg-silicon-valley","who":"Google Developers","localized_location":"Mountain View, CA","state":"CA","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Pacific"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdg-silicon-valley/events/248079012/","manual_attendance_count":130,"description":"<p>BADGING/RSVP POLICY</p> <p>Please help us with badging and sign-up for this Meetup with your first and last name by answering the question during RSVP.

(Mandy Waite)</p> <p>TITLE: The Creative Technologist<br/>Programming is an art form, yet we often view programming as a rote act. In this talk, we’ll explore the connections between the brain, technology, and creativity. You'll learn the benefits of creativity, how to practice it, and how you can use it to make you a better technologist. Corey Leigh Latislaw (coreylatislaw.com) is a Google Developer Expert in Android who has written many apps at companies large and small. She runs her own consulting firm and authors videos and books on Android programming.</p> <p>TITLE: OK so I built me a Kubernetes Cluster, what's next?<br/>Everybody got all fired up about Kubernetes and microservices but then many of us were like ‘Oh, darn, what’s going on?’. Well Istio gives us a view of the entire system and gives us a way to easily automate application network functions: control, configure, monitor application-level requests, ensure resilience, routing, observability, fault-injection and more. In this session we'll introduce you to Istio and to Service Meshes in general, and we'll explain why they are a big deal and how they are the next step in changing the way we build and run applications.</p> <p>Mandy Waite is a Developer Advocate at Google.</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1520293389000,"duration":9000000,"id":"248451246","name":"Containers for Networking and Kubernetes Runtime Security","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1522891800000,"local_date":"2018-04-04","local_time":"18:30","updated":1522943001000,"utc_offset":-25200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":442,"venue":{"id":25743757,"name":"Google Building PR55","lat":37.41489791870117,"lon":-122.07524108886719,"repinned":false,"address_1":"1255 Pear Avenue","city":"Mountain View","country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA"},"group":{"created":1234470551000,"name":"Google Developer Group Silicon Valley","id":1381929,"join_mode":"open","lat":37.40999984741211,"lon":-122.08000183105469,"urlname":"gdg-silicon-valley","who":"Google Developers","localized_location":"Mountain View, CA","state":"CA","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Pacific"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdg-silicon-valley/events/248451246/","description":"<p>This month we will be featuring a few talks.</p> <p>Speaker: Dr. Dinesh Subhraveti, Co-Founder &amp; CTO of appOrbit</p> <p>Title: Containers for Networking, not just Networking for Containers</p> <p>Abstract: Containers do a fantastic job of simplifying application management by operating close to the application layer and encapsulating just the minimal application state within the container abstraction. However, they don’t address the necessary network and storage counterparts which still remain as complex. In fact, containers place very specific requirements on networking and storage infrastructure to accommodate their scale and rate of churn.</p> <p>As an application platform, Kubernetes masks and absorbs the underlying infrastructure complexity by exposing well-designed interfaces to the application. However it has to ultimately rely on infra-level mechanisms such as iptables and overlays to support those interfaces. Truly addressing the complexity requires abstracting network to the application level. What is needed is not just to somehow plumb traditional networking into containers but a container-equivalent abstraction of networking that is fundamentally simple.</p> <p>Speaker: Jen Tong, Developer Advocate Google</p> <p>Title: Kubernetes Runtime Security</p> <p>Abstract: Containers make it easier than ever to prevent insecure deployments, but mistakes and new vulnerabilities happen. Runtime security focuses on responding to breaches as they occur, and gathering information for forensic analysis. In this talk Jen will guide you through common runtime security concerns, and discuss how they change as you move to containers and Kubernetes.</p> <p>#IWD</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1520294025000,"duration":10800000,"id":"248451480","name":"Beyond Containers Party and Tech Event - Cloud fluency & new innovations","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1522971000000,"local_date":"2018-04-05","local_time":"16:30","updated":1522990510000,"utc_offset":-25200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":152,"venue":{"id":4068682,"name":"Tech Museum of Innovation","lat":37.33185577392578,"lon":-121.89012908935547,"repinned":false,"address_1":"201 South Market Street","city":"San Jose","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"95113","state":"CA"},"group":{"created":1234470551000,"name":"Google Developer Group Silicon Valley","id":1381929,"join_mode":"open","lat":37.40999984741211,"lon":-122.08000183105469,"urlname":"gdg-silicon-valley","who":"Google Developers","localized_location":"Mountain View, CA","state":"CA","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Pacific"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdg-silicon-valley/events/248451480/","description":"<p>We are community partners for this event.</p> <p>RSVP at <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/apporbit-20-launch-party-tech-conference-tickets-43673371229\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/apporbit-20-launch-party-tech-conference-tickets-43673371229</a> for entry</p> <p>This event discusses deploying new technologies beyond containers, making applications cloud fluent, freeing applications from development lock-in, and enabling cloud independence and portability for total cost control &amp; management flexibility.</p> <p>Date: April 5th, 2018</p> <p>Time: 4:30pm - 7:30pm</p> <p>Venue: TechMuseum</p> <p>Parking Instructions: <a href=\"https://www.thetech.org/parking\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.thetech.org/parking</a></p> <p>Speakers &amp; Topics</p> <p>Mark Thiele, CIO &amp; CSO of Apcera/Ericsson</p> <p>\"The Critical New Technology Innovations\"</p> <p>Dr. Dinesh Subhraveti, Co-Founder &amp; CTO AppOrbit and Container Inventor</p> <p>\"Crucial Technologies Beyond Containers\"</p> <p>Rahul Ravulur, Co-Founder &amp; CEO AppOrbit</p> <p>\"Delivering Cloud Fluency, Application Freedom, &amp; Cloud Independence\"</p> <p>Aditya Vasudevan, Co-Founder &amp; VP Customer Success AppOrbit</p> <p>\"Live Application Modernization &amp; Cloud Portability Demonstration\"</p> <p>CIO Roundtable</p> <p>Marybeth La Motte, CEO Red Carpet - Moderator</p> <p>Peter Weis, VP &amp; CIO Mastson</p> <p>Trevor Schulze, CIO Micron</p> <p>Madhu Janardan, SVP &amp; Global Head of Ecosystems &amp; Alliances, Infosys</p> <p>Door Prizes!</p> <p>Google Home, Google Home Mini, &amp; Google Chromecast Ultra</p> <p>RSVP at <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/apporbit-20-launch-party-tech-conference-tickets-43673371229\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/apporbit-20-launch-party-tech-conference-tickets-43673371229</a> for entry</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1521595088000,"duration":25200000,"id":"248942067","name":"IWD: International Women's Day 2018","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1524328200000,"local_date":"2018-04-21","local_time":"09:30","updated":1525538612000,"utc_offset":-25200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":1,"venue":{"id":25775796,"name":"Google","lat":37.41217041015625,"lon":-122.01847839355469,"repinned":false,"address_1":"111 E Java Dr","city":"Sunnyvale","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"94089","state":"ca"},"group":{"created":1234470551000,"name":"Google Developer Group Silicon Valley","id":1381929,"join_mode":"open","lat":37.40999984741211,"lon":-122.08000183105469,"urlname":"gdg-silicon-valley","who":"Google Developers","localized_location":"Mountain View, CA","state":"CA","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Pacific"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdg-silicon-valley/events/248942067/","manual_attendance_count":50,"description":"<p>** TICKETS **<br/>This event is open to everyone, although a purchased ticket is required.

Your functional tests are great at testing *functionality*, but do they check how good the application looks? Do they check that the submit button is aligned with the edit box? Do they check that the background color is that perfect shade of pale? Nope. They check what is *in* that input field, and they even change the text and submit the form, but they don’t check how that form *looks* like.</p> <p>What if I told you that in less than 10 lines of code added to your *existing* tests, you can add vision to your existing tests, and check how the application looks – how the form looks like, and not just how it behaves. Moreover, once you have added vision to your existing tests, you can supercharge your existing functional checks and just check the whole page in one big assertion.</p> <p>In this talk, I will take existing functional tests written in JavaScript and Java, and add visual testing capabilities to them. I promise – in just 8 lines of code!</p> <p>Eran Barlev: a Technical Solution Engineer at Applitools, is a Software Engineer at heart with over 20 years of experience working primarily in compiled languages. He is the Founder of the Canadian Software Testing Board (www.cstb.ca) and an active member of the ISTQB (www.istqb.org - International Software Testing Qualifications Board). His true passion is automation and being able to automate visual testing of web, app and desktop application made his current position at Applitools a dream job.</p> <p>7:[masked]pm - The case for (more) connectivity (Justin Ribero)</p> <p>With 25 billion Near Field Communication (NFC) tags in the world and the ongoing expansion of connectivity on the web platform, what does an API like WebNFC bring to the web development experience?

Using the Hangouts Chat API, we can create bots that turn our chat rooms into useful tools that go beyond simple text communication. In this talk, we’ll introduce a new sample application that brings together the power of the Hangouts Chat API and Google Cloud Platform’s Natural Language (NLP) API to extract useful data from a chat between user and bot. We’ll then store and display that data to the user using the Google Sheets API. The goal of the application is to help users track their accomplished work and measure the time spent on these efforts, helping them maximize use of their time. While the demo app is Python+Django, developers can use any language supported by the Google APIs Client Libraries.</p> <p>SPEAKERS:</p> <p>WESLEY CHUN is the author of Prentice Hall's bestselling \"Core Python\" series, co-author of Python Web Development with Django, and has written for Linux Journal, CNET, and InformIT.

RSocket is an open source reactive networking protocol specially-designed for microservices communication with far less overhead than HTTP. Developed in collaboration with Netflix, Facebook, Pivotal, Alibaba and others, RSocket is designed to handle the challenges of communication between complex networks of services both within the data center and over the internet – extending to mobile devices and browsers. RSocket uses load balancing technology that predicts the best route to send messages understanding latency and error rates, while being able to run over standard transports (like TCP, HTTP/2 and WebSocket). This results in applications that are easier to scale, less failure-prone and easier to operate. In this session, Ryland will explain how RSocket can be used to simplify the way enterprises build and operate cloud-native applications by enabling traditional enterprise developers to build and scale sophisticated, cloud-native, distributed applications.</p> <p>Speaker: Ryland Degnan is a co-founder and CTO of Netifi, where he is working to lay the groundwork for the next generation of cloud-native applications. Prior to Netifi, he was a member of the Netflix Edge Platform team that created RSocket, Hystrix and RxJava. He has over 12 years of experience building scalable distributed systems at organizations like Netflix, Skydeck, and Cisco. Ryland holds a BA from Harvard University and an MSc from the University of Oxford.</p> <p>Focus on your code, not infrastructure, with Cloud Functions: When you build a backend to a web app or mobile app, you want to focus on your business logic, not on your infrastructure. At the same time, you want the infrastructure to always be there for you, ready to run your code. Google Cloud Functions does that for you.<br/>In this talk, we will follow the story of the fictional startup \"In Jest\", publishers of an app that tells jokes. At first, the developers at \"In Jest\" need to get a minimum viable product up and running in an hour. As their business grows they will have to integrate with Google Sheets, SQL databases, analytics systems, marketing systems and so on. We will see the 100 lines of code needed to make this happen, without having to worry the team about servers and data centers.</p> <p>Speaker: Martin Omander works for Google in Mountain View, California. His job in the Developer Relations team is to help developers build better software, and improve Google's Cloud Platform to make it even better for that purpose. In his spare time he manages to sneak in some game programming. Before Google, Martin worked at string of startups in Silicon Valley as a software engineer.</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1542266709000,"duration":9000000,"id":"256432094","name":"Flutter Live Viewing Party and meet the Flutter Team","rsvp_limit":200,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1543941000000,"local_date":"2018-12-04","local_time":"08:30","updated":1543951846000,"utc_offset":-28800000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":169,"venue":{"id":25746994,"name":"Crane Beach Meeting Room Google Bldg CL2 ","lat":37.42583465576172,"lon":-122.07229614257812,"repinned":true,"address_1":"1200 Crittenden Ln Mountain View, CA 94043","address_2":"1200 Crittenden Ln ","city":"Mountain View","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"94043","state":"ca"},"group":{"created":1234470551000,"name":"Google Developer Group Silicon Valley","id":1381929,"join_mode":"open","lat":37.40999984741211,"lon":-122.08000183105469,"urlname":"gdg-silicon-valley","who":"Google Developers","localized_location":"Mountain View, CA","state":"CA","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Pacific"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdg-silicon-valley/events/256432094/","description":"<p>Join the celebration of Flutter with the Flutter team at Google Mountain View office on December 4!</p> <p>The Flutter Team just announced #FlutterLive<br/><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/events/flutter-live/\" class=\"linkified\">https://developers.google.com/events/flutter-live/</a></p> <p>Presented from the Science Museum in London, Flutter Live is happening on December 4th.

What unique solution does ML provide? Are we using the right information to train our system? What is the impact of wrong results?</p> <p>Just like with the web and mobile revolutions, ML will force us to consider new possibilities for every experience we build. We must stay grounded in human needs while solving them in unique ways. HCML provides techniques to help us accomplish this.</p> <p>BIO: Google Developer Expert in Android Mike is a product-focused developer working out of Phoenix.

If you’ve done so in the past few years, an extension is probably based on Chromium’s current extensions platform, Manifest V2. The Chromium believes the Manifest V2 platform has a number of issues with respect to privacy, security, performance, and ergonomics and plans to address these issues by evolving the platform with Manifest V3. In this session, we’ll dive into some of the biggest issues with the Manifest V2 platform, where we’d like the platform to be, and how Manifest V3 will help us get there.</p> <p>Speaker - Aaron Ma</p> <p>Topic - Machine Learning in The Browser (Angular + TensorFlow.js)</p> <p>Description: More and more apps need machine learning.

This results in a governance problem: who maintains the complete build toolchain when an army of volunteers writes the plugins? It also inhibits innovation, since any new language/feature needs a plugin for each tool and any new tool needs plugins for every language/feature. Alex will talk about our plans to use Bazel as a build orchestrator to decouple tools from the toolchain.</p> <p>Hope to see you there!</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1553060356000,"duration":10800000,"id":"259921259","name":"Introduction to Flutter & CI as smooth as Flutter","rsvp_limit":250,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1554166800000,"local_date":"2019-04-01","local_time":"18:00","updated":1554182160000,"utc_offset":-25200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":192,"venue":{"id":26262475,"name":"1500 Crittenden Ln","lat":37.42488479614258,"lon":-122.07054901123047,"repinned":true,"address_1":"1500 Crittenden Ln","city":"Mountain View","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"94043","state":"CA"},"group":{"created":1234470551000,"name":"Google Developer Group Silicon Valley","id":1381929,"join_mode":"open","lat":37.40999984741211,"lon":-122.08000183105469,"urlname":"gdg-silicon-valley","who":"Google Developers","localized_location":"Mountain View, CA","state":"CA","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Pacific"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdg-silicon-valley/events/259921259/","description":"<p>Agenda:</p> <p>6:00-7:00: Socializing (Thanks Google for food and drinks!)<br/>7:00--7:10: Announcements<br/>7:10--7:50:Introduction to Flutter - Brett Morgan<br/>7:50-8:30: CI as smooth as Flutter - Mikhail Tokarev<br/>8:30-8:45: Q&amp;A</p> <p>Introduction to Flutter<br/>Flutter is Google’s mobile app SDK for crafting high-quality native interfaces on iOS and Android in record time.

This approach to using JavaScript, APIs and Markup is sometimes referred to as the JAMStack. This talk will walk through some of the challenges we faced with our node.js application servers and how we are trying to solve them by moving to this new model.

We walk through how to define action streams to react to user actions. Lastly, we’ll Observable all the things to display complex data with a single async pipe.<br/>Join me as we get to know another side of RxJS.</p> <p>Minko Gechev<br/>Angular team, Google<br/>\"Building JavaScript at Scale\"<br/>Over the last years the web tooling has evolved dramatically. Popular tools, such as Angular CLI and Create React App provide well encapsulated build that “just works!”<br/>Over time, however, we started building larger applications. Often so big that the time between code update and page reload takes tens of seconds instead of milliseconds. This is not only annoying but also reduces our productivity. An organization, which hit this problem early on is Google. To make engineers working on large applications productive, Google developed Bazel - a tool for building applications at scale.<br/>In this talk we’ll see how Bazel allows us to reduce our build time of our large applications in orders of magnitude! We’ll explain how it compiles our code in parallel, or even up in the ☁️. In the last part of the presentation, we’ll see how to use Bazel for our JavaScript at scale.</p> <p>Alex Eagle<br/>Angular’s Tooling team lead, Google<br/>\"Enterprise Bazel Migration Patterns\"</p> <p>Abraham Williams<br/>Senior Developer, Bendworks<br/>\"PWAs with Angular\"<br/>Get an overview of what Progressive Web Apps are and how they can make your website fast, reliable, and engaging.

This is more important than developing a set of rules or patterns you apply blindly. Guidelines help to formulate, drive and validate decisions. You can't begin to make the best decisions without understanding the impact of your decisions. Every decision you make, every line of code you write comes with trade-offs.</p> <p>When it comes to the Go programming language, Bill believes the language authors followed a set of design philosophies and guidelines that helped shape the language and its features. In this talk, Bill will discuss some of the design philosophies he believes are in sync with the Go programming language and how they can help you better understand the language and what it's attempting to accomplish.</p> <p>Speaker:</p> <p>Bill Kennedy is a managing partner at Ardan Labs in Miami, Florida, a mobile, web, and systems development company. He is also a co-author of the book Go in Action and a founding member of GoBridge which is working to increase Go adoption through diversity.</p> <p>Arden Labs: <a href=\"https://www.ardanlabs.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.ardanlabs.com/</a><br/>GoBridge: <a href=\"https://gobridge.org\" class=\"linkified\">https://gobridge.org</a></p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1579718423000,"duration":7200000,"id":"268117520","name":"Modern Web + GDGSV + Angular MTV February Event","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1581561000000,"local_date":"2020-02-12","local_time":"18:30","updated":1581570427000,"utc_offset":-28800000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":92,"venue":{"id":26064530,"name":"1255 Pear Ave","lat":37.41489791870117,"lon":-122.07524108886719,"repinned":true,"address_1":"1255 Pear Ave","city":"Mountain View","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"94043","state":"CA"},"group":{"created":1234470551000,"name":"Google Developer Group Silicon Valley","id":1381929,"join_mode":"open","lat":37.40999984741211,"lon":-122.08000183105469,"urlname":"gdg-silicon-valley","who":"Google Developers","localized_location":"Mountain View, CA","state":"CA","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Pacific"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdg-silicon-valley/events/268117520/","description":"<p>Hello, everyone!</p> <p>We are super excited to be hosting the first Modern Web + GDGSV + Angular MTV event of the year!</p> <p>When: February 12, 2020 from 6:30PM - 9:00PM<br/>Where: 1255 Pear Avenue, Mountain View, CA</p> <p>Our line-up of speakers include...</p> <p>Shruti Kapoor<br/>Senior Software Engineer, PayPal<br/>\"What is GraphQL - The Misconceptions?\"<br/>When you first heard of GraphQL, did you think it was a SQL type language? Did you think it was a graphing software? Did you think it was used for graph type data structures only? You are not alone! There are a lot of misconceptions about what is GraphQL and what the Graph and QL in GraphQL means. In this talk, I will be debunking common misconceptions about GraphQL.</p> <p>Hemanth H.M<br/>MTS, PayPal<br/>\"TC39\"<br/>Have you ever wondered, how you can influence the feature set in JavaScript?<br/>In this talk Hemanth, a TC39 delegate will give you an overview of the TC39 community and the proposal process.</p> <p>Hans Larsen<br/>Engineering Lead - SDK at DFINITY<br/>\"Using Angular with the Internet Computer\"<br/>DFINITY is reinventing the cloud by building the Internet Computer, a serverless and decentralized backend, providing a platform for open Internet services for all.<br/>In the next decade, the Internet will evolve by offering open versions of today’s most popular services such as LinkedIn, WhatsApp, and eBay. Interested in rebooting the internet in open form? With an open social network, you can focus on your application without worrying about growth or network effects, and use open services already available to add chat and social components easily.<br/>In this talk, I will present the vision of the Internet Computer, and present a list of schematics and builders to help develop, test and deploy Angular applications directly to it.
