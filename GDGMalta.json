This event is being organized by the Department of Artificial Intelligence together with the GoogleDevelopers Group in Malta and supported by Saint Martin’s Institute of Higher Education, the Malta Information Technology Agency and IXARIS.</p> <p>Next’17 Extended will start around 17:30 and it will feature two talks by industry experts. The first one will be based on the future of the cloud; in particular, it will look at various emerging technologies such as blockchain and cryptocurrencies amongst others. This is extremely important in view of the country’s drive to become a FinTech hub in the coming decade. The second talk will focus on open payments over the cloud. Both talks are extremely relevant in today’s world and participants will have the opportunity to ask questions to our experts. A networking event will follow after where participants can get to socialize and get to know our speakers personally.</p> <p>Through this event, we hope to help accelerate innovation through the capabilities of the cloud.

While we do it all the time in our physical world by designing posters, billboards, TV adverts and even websites or mobile apps, we still have a lot to learn in order to transfer our skills to the virtual 3D world. This talk will explore Google’s latest methodologies for designing for Virtual Reality and how we can translate traditional UI design to the virtual 3D world. Following the talk, there will be a networking session and demos of a variety of Virtual Reality applications. These demos include VR applications in Heritage, behind the scenes of 360-video filming and a VR-based user research experiment.</p> <p>The talk will be delivered by Dylan Seychell, a resident academic at St Martin’s Institute of Higher Education and the Lead of Malta’s Google Developers Group.

Any organisation can reap these benefits.</p> <p>Because of this, we decided to organise this workshop aimed at Managers and Executives. The workshop will be run by top AI experts, and they will explain what AI is and how it can benefit your organisation. We will then go through the steps necessary to help you become an AI-enabled company by analysing the strengths and weakness of the organisation and planning for a quick return on investment. By the end of the workshop, you should have a good idea of how you can use AI in your organisation.</p> <p>Please register for the event using the link below</p> <p><a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/aichamber\" class=\"linkified\">https://tinyurl.com/aichamber</a></p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1569351304000,"duration":10800000,"id":"265126347","name":"Hello World!
