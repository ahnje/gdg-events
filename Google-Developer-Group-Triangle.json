Maybe, like Pendo, you haven't made the jump from Angular JS 1.x in your code base yet but would still like to make use of Observables and Subjects inside of plain ES6 services to ease the transition... or just solve some of the communication problems inherent in the framework. Would you just like some more concrete examples of how Observables can be used in real life development? If so, this talk is for you.</p> <p>David Rogers will present two specific usage patterns we have employed using RxJS and Angular JS that allow us to dynamically update our UI based on continuous user input, along with some of the challenges and gotchas that we've encountered along the way.

The goal of Vue.js is to provide the benefits of reactive data binding and composable view components with an API that is as simple as possible.Framework7 - is a free and open source mobile HTML framework to develop hybrid mobile apps or web apps with iOS &amp; Android native look and feel. It is also an indispensable prototyping apps tool to show working app prototype as soon as possible in case you need to. </p> <p><b>Speaker: Tara Manicsic, Progress (KendoUI)</b></p> <p><b>Topic: Progressive Web Apps For The Win! </b></p> <p>There’s a lot of talk about PWAs not being able to replace native mobile apps, and guess what. It’s true! That doesn’t mean we should dismiss them, it means we should take advantage of what they can do for our current web apps. Let's take our regular, already awesome, Angular app and 'progress' it to include pre-caching, home screen implementation &amp; push notifications to make it faster and more engaging!</p> <p><b>Speaker: Doug Miller,  Citrix Systems, Inc</b></p> <p><b>Topic:  True Cross-Platform Applications with React</b></p> <p>React and React Native have come a long way in making sharing code possible between webapps and mobile apps.  We went from needing three different developers to write a feature, to one developer writing a feature twice in the same language.  This was a great step forward, but what if it possible to make that a single developer writing a feature only once?  This talk will explore building true cross-platform applications using dependency injection and a small set of primitives with shared interfaces across different platforms. </p> <p><b>This is the quarterly Triangle Modern Web event! <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/trianglemodernweb/events/241799844/\">Please RSVP here</a>.</b></p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1514933364000,"duration":9000000,"id":"246424289","name":"Full Stack Dev w JavaScript, NoSQL, Utility First CSS ++.

The backend and frontend technologies can be totally different. However, what if they did not have to be?</p> <p>In this session, we’re going to explore full stack development where each component is based on JavaScript and why keeping the technologies the same is a good thing. Then we’re going to see where NoSQL fits in and why it works so seamless with JavaScript.</p> <p>Utility First CSS - A Lightweight, Scalable Solution<br/>Speaker: Jake Dohm, Web Developer</p> <p>Description:<br/>In this session we'll talk about what Utility (or functional) CSS is, its common benefits and pitfalls, and address some common questions and concerns, like:<br/>- What about \"separation of concerns\"?<br/>- How is Utility CSS any different from inline styles?<br/>- Does the Utility First mindset hold up at a larger scale?<br/>- Does it have a positive or adverse effect on performance?</p> <p>More info coming soon!</p> <p>Want to speak at one of our events?

The problem is that this requires a big shift in thinking about how data interactions should look. Once you’re able to “think in GraphQL”, however, you won’t want to go back. I’ll show you how to do just that.</p> <p>Title: Open Source Web Components<br/>Speaker: Tom Dalbo, Senior Software Engineer on Red Hat Customer Platform</p> <p>Description:<br/>Web Components aren’t scary anymore! We’re building applications with RHElements - extensible, standards-based, accessible, and open source. This talk will walk through how you can build your applications with web components without having to sacrifice browser compatibility, accessibility, SEO, or conforming to a single front-end framework across your organization. More info coming soon.</p> <p>Title: NativeScript “Zero to Hero”<br/>Speaker: Mark Halpin, Software Developer &amp; NativeScript Expert</p> <p>Do you have a great idea for a mobile application, but don’t know Java or Swift? Do you want to develop an application as quickly as possible using the web skills you already have?</p> <p>If you haven’t heard of NativeScript, then you are in for a treat. NativeScript is framework that allows you to build cross platform mobile apps using common web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and XML that look, feel and perform like native applications. Not only can you use plain JavaScript, but you can also leverage the frameworks you already know to help build those native applications and integrate functionality such as location services, the camera, and push notifications. In this session, you will learn the basics of NativeScript and how to get started with Vue, as well as the tools you will need to start building and packaging native applications.</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1523884993000,"duration":20700000,"id":"249830830","name":"Google I/O Extended at the American Underground","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1525788000000,"local_date":"2018-05-08","local_time":"10:00","updated":1525815668000,"utc_offset":-14400000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":11,"venue":{"id":9598842,"name":"American Tobacco Underground","lat":35.99327850341797,"lon":-78.90409088134766,"repinned":false,"address_1":"318 Blackwell Street","city":"Durham","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"27701","state":"NC"},"group":{"created":1385061708000,"name":"Google Developer Group Triangle","id":11197652,"join_mode":"open","lat":36,"lon":-78.9000015258789,"urlname":"Google-Developer-Group-Triangle","who":"Developers","localized_location":"Durham, NC","state":"NC","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Eastern"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/Google-Developer-Group-Triangle/events/249830830/","description":"<p>Google, the GDG and Momentum Learning will co-host a Google I/O Extended in Durham's American Underground on May 8, 2018.

But what about the intrepid developers out there who want to play with machine learning using JavaScript? Is there a solution for them?</p> <p>The answer is yes. In this presentation, we will walk through training a neural network using BrainJS, a wonderful library that allows us to do this in a language most (all?) front-end and web developers are familiar with. Come and watch the birth of SkyNet with JS!</p> <p>Speaker: Marcus Hellburg, lead developer advocate at Vaadin, helping developers learn about modern web technologies, background in embedded systems but has worked on everything web related for the past 15+ years.</p> <p>“Hands-on with PWA and Web Components”</p> <p>Description:<br/>The web is turning into an application platform. Web Components give us a way of defining reusable UI components. Progressive Web Applications improve performance in poor network conditions. You can install them on your phone and they can send you notifications of important events.</p> <p>In this presentation, we'll learn the basics of Web Components and Progressive Web Applications by building a small application from scratch. After the presentation, you will have the skills needed to get started working on your own PWA.</p> <p>Speaker: Peter Elbaum, Software Engineer at Smashing Boxes</p> <p>“Cambridge Ana-cynical: Understanding the Facebook information scandal and its APIs”</p> <p>Description:<br/>In the spring of this year, it became public knowledge that as many as 87 million Facebook users had their data mined by an app developed by the political data firm Cambridge Analytica. These events prompted many questions including inquiries about whether or not the data access was legal. From a software development perspective, one wonders how exactly the data mining was achieved. With that in mind, this talk will dive into the breach and the capabilities of Facebook's public APIs. We will survey what people developing on Facebook's platform are able to accomplish and the data that's immediately available to them. We'll also demo of some of the common utilities that are possible using the Facebook Javascript SDK.</p> <p>Speaker: Jay Phelps, Reactive programming nut and compiler enthusiast.

But since it's so low level it can be difficult to see how it will revolutionize the next generation of web apps–and definitely not just games and C++! In this talk, Jay will reveal what it is, how you can use it today, and the incredible opportunities it will unlock in the years to come on both the Web and on Desktop.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/trianglemodernweb/events/250077088/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/trianglemodernweb/events/250077088/</a></p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1534164789000,"duration":7200000,"id":"253750484","name":"UX Research Methods, Rise of the Data Driven Business + More","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1537914600000,"local_date":"2018-09-25","local_time":"18:30","updated":1537924431000,"utc_offset":-14400000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":31,"venue":{"id":24674581,"name":"MDC","lat":35.996028900146484,"lon":-78.90286254882812,"repinned":false,"address_1":"307 West Main St.","city":"Durham","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"","state":"NC"},"group":{"created":1385061708000,"name":"Google Developer Group Triangle","id":11197652,"join_mode":"open","lat":36,"lon":-78.9000015258789,"urlname":"Google-Developer-Group-Triangle","who":"Developers","localized_location":"Durham, NC","state":"NC","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Eastern"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/Google-Developer-Group-Triangle/events/253750484/","description":"<p>Join us in Durham for some amazing talks and discussions!</p> <p>Melissa Eggleston, Director of User Experience, Teamworks</p> <p>Talk Title: UX Research Methods: No Ph.D. Needed</p> <p>Talk Description: What value does UX research bring to designers and developers?

With that in mind, we as developers can look at different categories of low vision including color vision, visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, etc and make an effort to bake in things like zoom, non-conflicting colors, and re-wrapping of columns in to our code.</p> <p>My talk will cover what vision accessibility is, different categories of low vision, what the needs of the users are, and what we as developers can do to achieve a great user experience for low vision users.</p> <p>Diana Rodriguez, Chief DevOps Architect at Voicethread<br/>Topic: Containers 101: Docker and Kubernetes Simplified</p> <p>Lightening Speakers:</p> <p>Kelly Carijen<br/>Topic: Focus: One way to get it and keep it</p> <p>James Luterek<br/>Topic: Trends in commerce</p> <p>BugZeroCodes<br/>Timothy, Daniel, and Eugene<br/>Topic: The role of kids in TECH, the fastest growing professional community in the world.</p> ","how_to_find_us":"4th Floor","visibility":"public"},{"created":1547829478000,"duration":7200000,"id":"258190817","name":"GDG Triangle / Women Techmakers Quarterly Meetup","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1554328800000,"local_date":"2019-04-03","local_time":"18:00","updated":1554340269000,"utc_offset":-14400000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":23,"venue":{"id":26041063,"name":"Smashing Boxes","lat":35.99040985107422,"lon":-78.89645385742188,"repinned":true,"address_1":"506 Ramseur St","city":"Durham","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"27701","state":"NC"},"group":{"created":1385061708000,"name":"Google Developer Group Triangle","id":11197652,"join_mode":"open","lat":36,"lon":-78.9000015258789,"urlname":"Google-Developer-Group-Triangle","who":"Developers","localized_location":"Durham, NC","state":"NC","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Eastern"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/Google-Developer-Group-Triangle/events/258190817/","description":"<p>Please join us for the quarterly GDG Triangle partnered with Women Techmakers meetup.</p> <p>Speaker Lineup:<br/>Leila Alderman<br/>Topic: Save the world from your couch with open-source mapping</p> <p>Humanitarian crises happen all too often and frequently happen in places far from our homes. One way we can help is to provide up-to-date map information for the affected regions. This may sound complicated, but it’s actually so easy that anyone with a laptop can do it. Really, anyone!</p> <p>While map information for the U.S. is pretty great, the map information for people escaping a violent militia near Lake Chad is pretty poor because nobody has needed to or been paid to map that area. As humanitarian relief efforts put boots on the ground, they need maps, but they often lack even just the basics of which roads go where.</p> <p>By looking at an up-to-date satellite image, you can trace roads or draw a box around the hospitals and schools in a town with a few clicks of your mouse. Adding this data to an open-source map can save lives even within an hour of the update.</p> <p>In short, if you can trace lines with your mouse, you can save lives!</p> <p>Joy Kaufman<br/>Topic: Imposter syndrome vs cognitive dissonance for women</p> ","how_to_find_us":"Parking for this event is located at the dirt parking lot directly next to Smashing Boxes.
