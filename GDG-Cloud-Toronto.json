Registration is now open for Hash Code, Google’s flagship team coding competition that challenges developers to solve a Google engineering problem, like perfecting video streaming on YouTube or routing Loon balloons.</p> <p>Hash Code is a team programming competition, organized by Google, for students and professionals around the world. You pick your team and programming language and we pick an engineering problem for you to solve. This year’s contest kicks off with an Online Qualification Round, where your team can compete from wherever you’d like, including from one of our Hash Code hubs. Top teams will then be invited to a Google office for the Final Round.</p> <p>We will share the Registration and more details shortly. RSVP and Stay Tuned.</p> <p>Once you’ve registered for the contest, you’ll gain access to our Judge System. The Judge System is our online platform where you’ll form your team, join a hub, practice, and compete during the rounds. During the Online Qualification Round, you’ll watch our YouTube livestream to be introduced to the problem, and your team will have four hours to solve an optimization problem using the programming language and tools of your choice. Teams can compete from a local hub or another location of their choice.
