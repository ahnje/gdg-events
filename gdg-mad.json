We actually put together a meetup in December. Well, almost a meetup.<br/>Come join us for a year-end kinda-meetup at Grandmama's cafe, Dadar East, for avocado toast and hot chocolate, and of course, conversations, reminiscing and plans.<br/>The \"meetup\" starts at 1, and doesn't have a fixed end time. You can get there earlier, but we won't be there so you'll have to sit by your lonesome, and you can leave early but we'll do our best to convince you to stay.</p> <p>Given the location, we have limited seating, so we've enabled a waitlist and we'll confirm your attendance in the upcoming week.</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1581339617000,"duration":14400000,"id":"268602296","name":"GDG MAD, February 2020 Meetup","rsvp_limit":100,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1582950600000,"local_date":"2020-02-29","local_time":"10:00","updated":1582967019000,"utc_offset":19800000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":100,"venue":{"id":26123066,"name":"BookMyShow Mumbai Office","lat":19.108854293823242,"lon":72.85440826416016,"repinned":true,"address_1":"14, Sahar Rd","city":"Mumbai","country":"in","localized_country_name":"India"},"group":{"created":1539089377000,"name":"GDG MAD","id":30161920,"join_mode":"open","lat":18.959999084472656,"lon":72.81999969482422,"urlname":"gdg-mad","who":"Members","localized_location":"Mumbai, India","state":"","country":"in","region":"en_US","timezone":"Asia/Calcutta"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdg-mad/events/268602296/","description":"<p>Think of this as an open mic but for your careers!
