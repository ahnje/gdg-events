We all know the value of open source projects. The current state of software/hardware development would not be possible without opensource projects.</p> <p>This is a beginner friendly event. Even if you have not contributed to any open source projects before. You will be introduced to the code of conducts that projects follow and teach you how to contribute.</p> <p>That being said it's better if you already have practical knowledge of building software. Anything from HTML, css, js, react, vue, c, c++, java, ruby, PHP, Android, nodejs, sass, etc.. But even if you don't have any experience on that part but would like to attend you are more than welcome.</p> <p>Please don't forget to bring your laptops and preferably mobile hotspots so as to not to depend on the venue's wifi.</p> <p>Software and prerequisites,<br/>Basically, you will be needing git software installed. Apart from that if you know what you are contributing to, set up related to that project would be necessary. If you are planning to hop on a new project/issue. Come with just git installed on your machine.</p> <p>Do leave a comment if you have any questions</p> <p>Thanks to Jellycone for letting us use their space.
