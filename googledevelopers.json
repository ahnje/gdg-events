I started programming in 2011 while I was in a high school program that involved learning about web technologies and website development. I branched off on my own during that time to learn as much as I could about other programming languages because I felt that knowing just one thing wouldn't be enough. My interest progressed as I took college classes in computer science, and eventually I took an Android app development course at Fresno City in 2014. I taught myself a lot of extra stuff regarding app development and using other technologies in conjunction with it, such as other APIs. I'm currently the teacher's assistant and tutor for the current iteration of the Android app development course at FCC. On the other hand I also really enjoy the theoretical aspect of computer science and the more mathematical side of things, and I think that because of this, I someday want to pursue computer science research. I hope to transfer to UCLA or UC Berkeley in the Fall if I'm accepted into their programs. </p> <p>Historical information regarding my app:</p> <p>Version 1.0 of my app was the product of a suggestion from one of my friends to create an app to rival the infamous \"Muffin Button\" (I don't actually know if it's infamous). My app had, for the most part, graphics and colors that were meant to be temporary. However after I had written it I thought that it would be funny to leave it as it is and just publish it, the first reason being that I kind of liked the lo-fi feel of it since it was already an essentially useless app, and secondly because I didn't want to look at it any more. After receiving a low review on the Play Store and my number of installs had dropped significantly, I realized that I needed to do something raise my app standards. I made the app look much nicer than it did previously, and I added features such as being able to download quantum random coordinates from the Australian National University's Quantum Optics lab. The work put into this aspect was justifiable mostly because the only llama related thing funnier than a lo-fi llama button app is a completely overpowered llama app that actually uses cutting edge research (I wasn't sure that the llamas were 'random' enough). I also did it because I wanted an excuse to use the ANU Quantum Optics random number generator APIs that people on GitHub had written. </p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1422055472000,"id":"lrsbflytdbjb","name":"Android Fundamentals Study Jam Kick Off!","rsvp_limit":30,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1423274400000,"local_date":"2015-02-06","local_time":"18:00","updated":1423293278000,"utc_offset":-28800000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":16,"venue":{"id":1560510,"name":"Fresno City College","lat":36.76677703857422,"lon":-119.79986572265625,"repinned":false,"address_1":"1101 E University Ave, Fresno, CA, 93704-6219","city":"Fresno","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"93704","state":"CA"},"group":{"created":1370492581000,"name":"GDG Fresno (Google Developer Group)","id":8806052,"join_mode":"open","lat":36.79999923706055,"lon":-119.87999725341797,"urlname":"googledevelopers","who":"Google Developers","localized_location":"Fresno, CA","state":"CA","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Pacific"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/googledevelopers/events/lrsbflytdbjb/","description":"<p>Google Developers Study Jams is a free series of global, community-run, in-person study groups.

Go provides the ability for \"server-side\" programming. Traditional choices for server-side languages have included PHP, ASP, and JSP. Increasingly popular server-side programming languages include Ruby, Python, and Node.js. While there are advantages and disadvantages to all languages, no server-side language is going to be faster than \"Go.\" Couple the speed of Go with Google App Engine and Cloud Storage, and you are now using the exact same architecture as Google. This means that your web apps are going to be incredibly fast and will easily scale to millions of users. Go is an amazing choice for a server-side language as it was developed by some of the same individuals who created the C programming language, one of the most influential programming languages of all time. Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson created Go to be a modern language that easily uses multiple cores, easily implements concurrency, easily works in distributed environments, and easily allows the programmer to write programs - it has a very lean and user-friendly syntax! Come learn about one of the most awesome and exciting languages ever created.

His first Linux experience was with Slackware (1995), then for a long time he was Debian enthusiast also including Adamantix (Trusted Debian -  a hardened/secured version). He is very security savvy which led him to convert to Gentoo in 2003, more specifically Hardened Gentoo (an extremely secured version of Gentoo) from the beginning.

If you are a newcomer, you might be tempted to jump straight into using a graphic design tool, like Sketch or Photoshop. However, there is a high possibility that this path will lead you to do work that is unnecessary. Or, even worse, lead you to design a product that users don’t want. So, what are your options then? Here’s an idea…How about taking a more holistic approach and starting with the story? In her book, The User’s Journey: Storymapping Products that People Love, Donna Lichaw highlights how important the use of story is when designing a new or existing product. She goes on to outline three important techniques: the concept story, the origin story, and the usage story. This talk is an overview of how she describes story when it's applied to product design. It will also walk you through how to use those three techniques with a custom-made example.</p> <p>Joshwin Greene is a long-time member of GDG Fresno and WTM Fresno.
