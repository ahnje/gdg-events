That means we'll mostly just be hanging out and talking on the Gordon Biersch patio, weather permitting, so there won't be any speakers or demos scheduled (and you're totally going to be paying for your own check!) But that also means you can show up a little late or leave early, no problem.</p> <p>We're just going to have a little social time, make friends and enjoy the evening, much like our 2011 meeting. But this time we're going to devise our schemes, er, make our plans for upcoming meetings. So if you have an idea about something you might want to speak about in the future, that would be so very welcome.</p> <p>We'll put the details on our newly-minted Meetup group soon as well if you want to join there, but no RSVP is needed — you can just drop by. Hope you can join us for the inaugural GDG LA meeting!</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1357763539000,"id":"98781352","name":"Join Us for Our First Meetup of 2013!","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1358476200000,"local_date":"2013-01-17","local_time":"18:30","updated":1358523298000,"utc_offset":-28800000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":16,"venue":{"id":11069152,"name":"MK Partners","lat":34.16463088989258,"lon":-118.37142181396484,"repinned":false,"address_1":"11024 Magnolia Boulevard","city":"North Hollywood","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"91601","state":"CA"},"group":{"created":1336418770000,"name":"Google Developer Group Los Angeles","id":3817652,"join_mode":"open","lat":34.09000015258789,"lon":-118.33999633789062,"urlname":"gdg-la","who":"Developers","localized_location":"Los Angeles, CA","state":"CA","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Pacific"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdg-la/events/98781352/","description":"<p>Please join us in North Hollywood for our first meetup of the year!</p> <p>We'll discuss Apps Script, oAuth, Prediction API and more.</p> <p> </p> ","how_to_find_us":"Come to the 2nd Floor","visibility":"public"},{"created":1361907029000,"duration":7200000,"id":"106533922","name":"Intro to Google Analytics Content Experiments and Google Code Jam","rsvp_limit":9,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1362538800000,"local_date":"2013-03-05","local_time":"19:00","updated":1362546146000,"utc_offset":-28800000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":9,"venue":{"id":6574462,"name":"Taurad, LLC","lat":33.97813415527344,"lon":-118.39435577392578,"repinned":false,"address_1":"6733 South Sepulveda","city":"Los Angeles","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"90045","state":"CA"},"group":{"created":1336418770000,"name":"Google Developer Group Los Angeles","id":3817652,"join_mode":"open","lat":34.09000015258789,"lon":-118.33999633789062,"urlname":"gdg-la","who":"Developers","localized_location":"Los Angeles, CA","state":"CA","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Pacific"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdg-la/events/106533922/","description":"<p>Huge thanks to Taurad and Scott Wiseman for setting up our first 405-adjacent meeting!

But if so, RSVP now.</p> <p>I will be presenting on two topics: one is slightly technical and one extremely nerdy — something for everyone! Here's the schedule:</p> <p> </p> <p>• 7:00 - 7:15 Conversation time</p> <p>• 7:15 - 7:30 Announcements and group introductions</p> <p>• 7:30 - 8:10 Introduction to Google Analytics Content Experiments</p> <p>• 8:20 - 9:00 Introduction to Google Code Jam (I'll demonstrate using my Ruby library for Google Code Jam, but it will also be a general overview)</p> <p> </p> <p>Again, since we will fill up, if you RSVP and turn out to be unable to make it, change your RSVP to No to allow another to attend.  I will present the Google Analytics Content Experiments at our next meeting, which is scheduled to be back at MK Partners in NoHo, later in March (details to follow). And rest assured, we will be back in the 310 soon!</p> <p>HUGE thanks to Scott Wiseman at Taurad for stepping up and making this happen by offering us this venue.

I decided I needed a way to search for people in order to speed up my workflow.<br/>This resulted in the design and implementation of a pet project called Aura. This presentation is about the process of creating Aura and how it gathered a cult following of support at Credit Karma. I will be covering the problem space, the technology and the methods of winning mind share that led to the execution of the project. This includes React, Electron, Firebase and a host of other libraries and services that allowed Aura to be built over some weekends without the need of a server.</p> <p><b><br/></b></p> <p><b>DIRECTIONS &amp; PARKING INFORMATION:</b></p> <p>Public transportation, ridesharing, carpooling, biking, and walking are encouraged.

This session will cover the basics of Polymer and web components in general and why they're important to pay attention to, even if you aren't a web developer. With the backing of Google, and use by major companies like Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Comcast, and of course Google in large scale projects, it's a safe bet Polymer's only just getting started.</p> <p>Chrome Dev Tools for Beginners - Anna Veretennikova<br/>Chrome DevTools are a developer’s best friend.
