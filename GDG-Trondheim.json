We use a case study to explore a possible future without NgModules but Standalone Components, the use of dynamic components or higher-order components, zone-less change detection, and new possibilities for lazy loading and plug-in systems.</p> <p>In the end, you understand Ivy's potential and how to start preparing for it today.</p> <p>------------------------</p> <p>Title: TBD by Fabriece Sumuni<br/>Abstract: TBD</p> <p>------------------------</p> <p>Title: Angular Elements for Authentication: The what, the how and the why by Ana Cidre</p> <p>Abstract:<br/>In this talk, we will take a look at what Angular Elements are, what they consist of and how to build them.

We will also talk about what options we have today to build Web Components, which frameworks support them and whether browsers are ready for them.</p> <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Our Speakers' biography:</p> <p>Manfred Steyer:<br/>Trainer, consultant and programming architect with a focus on Angular.

A flexible data model gives you a lot of choices, but which way is the right way? Is a document database even the right tool?</p> <p>In this session we’ll go over the basics of data modeling using JSON. We’ll compare and contrast with traditional RDBMS modeling. Impact on application code will be discussed, as well as some tooling that could be helpful along the way. The examples use the free, open-source Couchbase Server document database, but the principles from this session can also be applied to CosmosDb, Mongo, RavenDb, etc.</p> <p>**Speaker:**<br/>Matthew D. Groves is a guy who loves to code. It doesn't matter if it's C#, jQuery, or PHP: he'll submit pull requests for anything. He has been coding professionally ever since he wrote a QuickBASIC point-of-sale app for his parent's pizza shop back in the 90s. He currently works as a Developer Advocate for Couchbase. His free time is spent with his family, watching the Reds, and getting involved in the developer community. He is the author of AOP in .NET (published by Manning), and is also a Microsoft MVP.</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1588102788000,"duration":3600000,"id":"270320649","name":"[Online] The GUI is a prison: Automate your GCP infrastructure with Ansible!","rsvp_limit":1,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1589466600000,"local_date":"2020-05-14","local_time":"16:30","updated":1589474644000,"utc_offset":7200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":1,"venue":{"id":26906060,"name":"Online event","repinned":false,"country":"","localized_country_name":""},"is_online_event":true,"group":{"created":1380653072000,"name":"Google Developer Group Trondheim (GDG)","id":10509002,"join_mode":"open","lat":63.439998626708984,"lon":10.399999618530273,"urlname":"GDG-Trondheim","who":"Members","localized_location":"Trondheim, Norway","state":"","country":"no","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Oslo"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Trondheim/events/270320649/","description":"<p>This is an event hosted by GDG-Cloud-Norway, so go there and signup for attendance: <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Cloud-Norway/events/269693769/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Cloud-Norway/events/269693769/</a></p> <p>**Talk:**<br/>The GUI is a prison: Automate your GCP infrastructure with Ansible!</p> <p>Configuring your infrastructure through the GUI or shell is a buggy, time consuming, hard to audit and error prone exercise.

It takes discipline to use container technology. It may not be as secure nor as optimal as you thought it would be. Although it’s relatively easy to create a new immutable container image to run everywhere, you may have fallen into many of the caveats. Is it running as the root user? Why are the images taking so much space? Why did your containers run out of space in the first place!? Most importantly, your container images may not be as immutable nor repeatable as you thought, and your Java process might be overutilizing assigned resources! Attend this session to learn how to best address these issues when building your Java container images.</p> <p>**Speaker:**<br/>Ray Tsang<br/>Ray is a Developer Advocate for the Google Cloud Platform and a Java Champion.
