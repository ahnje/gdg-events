From computing and storage, to data analytics, machine learning, and networking, GCP offers a wide variety of services and APIs that can be integrated with any cloud-computing application or project—be it personal or enterprise-grade.</p> <p>In this introductory-level lab, you will take your first steps with GCP by getting hands-on practice with the Google Cloud Platform console—an in-browser UI that lets you access and manage Google Cloud services. You will identify key features of GCP and also learn the ins and outs of the Qwiklabs environment. If you are new to cloud computing or looking for an overview of GCP and Qwiklabs, you are in the right place.
