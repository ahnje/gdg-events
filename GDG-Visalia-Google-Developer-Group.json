Food will be provided.</p> <p>Our presentation will begin at 6 pm. If you missed last week, you missed the unboxing and initial tries with our new 3D scanner. We will show you some of the scans and 3D prints from that. John Redden will demonstrate and go over the code for a new programming project to create a repository for our 3D scans - upload, catalog and display. One idea is to scan in the skulls and bones for our anthropology professor, so they would be available for students to view outside of class. Take a look at the scan of the lower jaw of a sabertooth cat that was made last week.<br/><a href=\"https://fnlgames-8a375.firebaseapp.com/scanRepo/viewer.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://fnlgames-8a375.firebaseapp.com/scanRepo/viewer.html</a></p> <p>Some of you may have received some spam that appeared to come from FNLHub. If you did, we apologize and we are addressing the issue. We will include it as a topic of discussion for Friday night.</p> <p>After the presentation, we will continue working in project groups. We have some great projects in the works, but we will also have a discussion on new project ideas. So, if you are not currently working on a project, but you want to, now is the time to jump in and get on a project team. We want to have several projects completed and ready to present at the COS STEMposium in August. If you have an idea, let us know about it. Newcomers are always welcome!
