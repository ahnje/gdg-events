Overview<br/>ARCore is a platform for building augmented reality apps on Android. ARCore uses three key technologies to integrate virtual content with the real world as seen through your phone's camera:</p> <p>- Motion tracking allows the phone to understand and track its position relative to the world.<br/>- Environmental understanding allows the phone to detect the size and location of flat horizontal surfaces like the ground or a coffee table.<br/>- Light estimation allows the phone to estimate the environment's current lighting conditions.</p> <p>This codelab guides you through building a simple demo game to introduce these capabilities so you can use them in your own applications.</p> <p>2. What you'll learn<br/>- Enabling ARCore through the Player settings<br/>- Adding the ARCore SDK prefabs to the scene<br/>- Scaling objects consistently to look reasonable with respect to the real world.<br/>- Using Anchors to place objects at a fixed location relative to the real world.<br/>- Using detected planes as the foundation of augmented reality objects<br/>- Using touch and gaze input to interact with the ARCore scene<br/>Prerequisites<br/>- Make sure you have these before starting the codelab:</p> <p>Unity Game Engine<br/>- Recommended version: Unity[masked] LTS or later<br/>- Minimum version:[masked]f2<br/>- JDK 8 (JDK 9 is currently not supported by Unity, use JDK 8 instead)</p> <p>ARCore SDK for Unity<br/>- Recommended version: v1.2.0 or later (arcore-unity-sdk-v1.2.0.unitypackage)<br/>- Minimum version: v1.0.0<br/>Other items<br/>- Sample assets for the project (arcore-intro.unitypackage, hosted on GitHub)<br/>- ARCore supported device and USB cable</p> <p>More information about getting started can be found at: developers.google.com/ar/develop/unity/getting-started</p> <p>Now that you have everything you need, let's start!</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1533650455000,"duration":108000000,"id":"253580465","name":"Flutter Study Jam - Jakarta","rsvp_limit":70,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1533956400000,"local_date":"2018-08-11","local_time":"10:00","updated":1535092179000,"utc_offset":25200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":70,"venue":{"id":25379069,"name":"Menara by KIBAR","lat":-6.192009925842285,"lon":106.84109497070312,"repinned":true,"address_1":"Jl.
