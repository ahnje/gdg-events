Cloud Load Balancing</b></p> <p><b>Abstract:</b></p> <p>Running services in multiple regions comes with both benefits and complications. Benefits include higher availability and lower latency to global users. Complications, however, can mount, especially for hybrid and multi-cloud deployments that face considerable security and connectivity constraints. So you may settle for running your services in a single region or even a single zone. During this meetup, I will show you how <a href=\"http://kubernetes.io/\">Kubernetes</a> and containers can make systems easier to manage and deploy. We will also take a closer look at Google Cloud's networking capabilities such as the global HTTPs Load Balancer and Cloud DNS services and shows you how to use these capabilities with Kubernetes to create a truly global service.</p> <p><b>Bio:</b></p> <p>Vadim is a founder and CTO of <a href=\"https://www.doit-intl.com/\">DoiT International</a> - a developers founded cloud consultancy company providing professional services for startups.
