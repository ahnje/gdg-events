She will share the process that took about four months and 200 TiB of storage. Record-breaking Pi calculations have traditionally been done on supercomputers and special-made hardware, but we did it on Cloud for the first time. In this talk she will discuss the nature of the calculation, the architecture, challenges and techniques, and of course the brief history of Pi computation.</p> <p>Calculating Pi has been the speaker's childhood dream and this talk will also explain how the small dream grew to the new world record.</p> <p>Places amount limited.
