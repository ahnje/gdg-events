Meetings provided by this chapter will focus around Cloud and GCP, but not only from development and operation perspective - remember that you, as a part of community, will decide which topics will be most popular and therefore organized.</p> <p>We have limited seats available, and we expect they will fill quickly, so we encourage you to apply early if you'd like to attend. Every applicant will be notified of their status a few days before the event, January 31st.
