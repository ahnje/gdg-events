Most of us have been burned in one way or the other due to the lack of clarity on what Context is on Android and how to use it.</p> <p>In this talk, Adnan will try to demystify what context is on Android &amp; explain the various options and their implications. We will try and understand how the various contexts differ and why should you as developer care. We will also have a final cheat sheet to use going forward so that you are absolutely sure about which context to use &amp; when.</p> ","how_to_find_us":"https://youtu.be/UZSEyTZ1xTo","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1589619932000,"duration":5400000,"id":"270687985","name":"#115 - BlrDroid May 2020 Meetup - Online","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1590237000000,"local_date":"2020-05-23","local_time":"18:00","updated":1590244116000,"utc_offset":19800000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":236,"venue":{"id":26906060,"name":"Online event","repinned":false,"country":"","localized_country_name":""},"is_online_event":true,"group":{"created":1255087900000,"name":"GDG Blrdroid - Bangalore Android Developers Group","id":1537455,"join_mode":"open","lat":12.970000267028809,"lon":77.55999755859375,"urlname":"blrdroid","who":"Android Explorers","localized_location":"Bangalore, India","state":"","country":"in","region":"en_US","timezone":"Asia/Calcutta"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/blrdroid/events/270687985/","description":"<p>Hello All,</p> <p>We are back with our second online meetup.
