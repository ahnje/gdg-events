From the days of Selenium to Webdriver, and now Protractor written specifically for Angular, this type of testing has taken far too much time and has been largely unproductive. The tests take too long to run and fail intermittently for no apparent reason at all. It's difficult to test features of an application without spending lots of time setting up \"magic data\" scenarios so we can verify that each aspect our application works as expected. This arduous process leads many developers to frustration and eventually resigning to using E2E testing for simple smoke tests.</p> <p>No More!</p> <p>Introducing Cypress.io, a new way of doing E2E tests that makes life incredibly simple and easy to manage. Cypress allows developers to focus on what's important and get the results we want without having to jump through a million hoops. We will be exploring what Cypress.io has to offer, how to set it up, and how it will change how you look at E2E tests.</p> <p>**** Speaker Bio ****<br/>Jesse Sanders is the founder and CEO of BrieBug and a Google Developer Expert (GDE) in Angular and Web Technologies.
