Istio supports managing traffic flows between microservices, enforcing access policies, and aggregating telemetry data, <i><b>all without requiring changes to the microservice code</b></i>.</p> <p>You will get an overview of what Istio is and why you would use it.</p> <p>Speaker: Alex Van Boxel (Google Developer Expert)</p> <p><b> Resilient Microservices with Containers, Kubernetes and Google Cloud</b><br/>Creating a single microservice is a well understood problem. Creating a cluster of load-balanced microservices that are resilient and self-healing is not so easy. Managing that cluster with rollouts and rollbacks, scaling individual services on demand, securely sharing secrets and configuration among services is even harder. Kubernetes, an open-source container management system, can help with this. In this talk, we will hear from Blendle who has made this journey from Monolith to Microservices, and will learn what makes Kubernetes a great system for automating deployment, operations, and scaling of containerized applications.</p> <p>Speaker: Niels Stevens (Software Engineer Blendle)</p> <p><i>Location and Pizza at Fourcast - Google Cloud Partner</i></p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1507750014000,"id":"244121486","name":"Apache Beam workshop on Cloud Dataflow","rsvp_limit":50,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1509035400000,"local_date":"2017-10-26","local_time":"18:30","updated":1509101425000,"utc_offset":7200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":21,"venue":{"id":25279928,"name":"Ordina","lat":51.05179977416992,"lon":4.4541449546813965,"repinned":false,"address_1":"Blarenberglaan 3B","city":"Mechelen","country":"be","localized_country_name":"Belgium"},"group":{"created":1452895054000,"name":"GDG Cloud - Belgium","id":19345355,"join_mode":"open","lat":50.83000183105469,"lon":4.329999923706055,"urlname":"GDG-Cloud-Belgium","who":"Developers","localized_location":"Brussels, Belgium","state":"","country":"be","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Brussels"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Cloud-Belgium/events/244121486/","description":"<p>We know you always wanted to try and build an <b>Apache Beam</b> pipeline on Cloud Dataflow.

You can also use Beam for Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) tasks and pure data integration.
