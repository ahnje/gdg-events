It is designed to be expressive, concise and clean. Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the convenience of garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection but has a simple and extensible sytax so it combines the power and efficiency of compiled languages with the flexibility and ease of use of interpreted languages. It was built from the ground up to be a concurrent language and its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of multicore and networked machines.</p> <p>Come and see Casey Borders as he introduces to the language and shows how Go simplified tasks that would be much harder is other languages.</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1349195050000,"id":"85130052","name":"Google Gadgets and Fun","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1350601200000,"local_date":"2012-10-18","local_time":"19:00","updated":1350612481000,"utc_offset":-14400000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":5,"venue":{"id":2874501,"name":"Improving Enterprises","lat":40.047691345214844,"lon":-82.90995788574219,"repinned":false,"address_1":"4449 Easton Way, Suite 100","city":"Columbus","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"43219","state":"OH"},"group":{"created":1341430387000,"name":"GDG Columbus","id":4232402,"join_mode":"open","lat":40.099998474121094,"lon":-83.0199966430664,"urlname":"GDG-Columbus","who":"Developers","localized_location":"Columbus, OH","state":"OH","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Eastern"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Columbus/events/85130052/","description":"<p>Going to talk about Google Contextual Gadgets in Gmail, Hangout Apps and hopefully spread some love and cheer.  Looking forward to seeing everyone.</p> <p> </p> <p><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/google-apps/gmail/contextual_gadgets\"><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/google-apps/gmail/contextual_gadgets\" class=\"linkified\">https://developers.google.com/google-apps/gmail/contextual_gadgets</a></a></p> <p><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/gadgets/\"><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/gadgets/\" class=\"linkified\">https://developers.google.com/gadgets/</a></a></p> <p><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/+/hangouts/writing\"><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/+/hangouts/writing\" class=\"linkified\">https://developers.google.com/+/hangouts/writing</a></a></p> <p> </p> <p>--Pete Gordon</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1352983237000,"id":"91504312","name":"No regular GDG this month--but 3d printers are cool!","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1353027600000,"local_date":"2012-11-15","local_time":"20:00","updated":1353038943000,"utc_offset":-18000000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":1,"venue":{"id":1456752,"name":"The Columbus Idea Foundry","lat":39.98762893676758,"lon":-82.9903335571289,"repinned":false,"address_1":"1158 Corrugated Way","city":"Columbus","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","phone":"614 531-8218","zip":"43201","state":"OH"},"group":{"created":1341430387000,"name":"GDG Columbus","id":4232402,"join_mode":"open","lat":40.099998474121094,"lon":-83.0199966430664,"urlname":"GDG-Columbus","who":"Developers","localized_location":"Columbus, OH","state":"OH","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Eastern"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Columbus/events/91504312/","description":"<p>We are not doing our usual Google meetup this month.

The Android Test framework is slow, and requires either an emulator or a physical device to test upon. There are other solutions like Robotium or UIAutomator but these lend themselves to writing tests that drive the UI and lean toward Integration tests. While these are necessary part of testing, they don't provide quick feed back to the developer. In this talk David Carver will discuss lessons learned from using Robolectric 2.3 and Mockito to bring some sanity to unit testing Android applications. Allowing for a true test driven development with fast test execution and fast developer feedback of failures. We will review some dos and don'ts when using Robolectric, and when Mockito may be a better fit. Examples will be shown from using these frameworks to provide unit test coverage for an Android TV application, but the same techniques can be used for any Android application.</p> <p>David Carver has over 20 years in software development, ranging from the big old Mainframe to mobile applications. His primary expertise are in E-Commerce and business to business development and deployment. He is a co-creator of the XSL Tools project at eclipse, and has been a committer on several eclipse projects including Vex, XQuery Tools. He is creator of Serenity for Android a Plex Media Server client focused on the 10 foot viewing experience for Android TV, Google TV, and Amazon Fire TV devices.

So, it's time to ramp up your Android Mobile app ideas and get to coding. We will be holding an informational kick-off event on March 30th at 6pm during the last Android Study Jam at Pillar Technologies' the Forge (please RSVP on meetup.com). Here's the low down.

He has spent the last year live streaming himself for an hour a day, every weekday, developing a productional quality game completely from scratch using absolutely no libraries or frameworks. This took off beyond his wildest dreams and he's decided to try to put on a conference based on the series.</p> <p>For HandmadeCon he has lined up a full day's worth of amazing speakers from the games industry and, in the spirit of Handmade Hero, he's live streaming the whole thing! Here's the schedule for the day. (All times are in EST)</p> <p><b>1:30pm - 2:45pm<br/>Tommy Refenes </b><br/>Kicking off the conference is none other than Tommy Refenes, the sole programmer behind the massive hit Super Meat Boy. Extremely difficult platformers like this live and die by their control schemes, and Super Meat Boy stands out as a universally lauded example of how to do player controls right.<br/>Platformer control programming is still much more art than science, so I really wanted to talk to Tommy about how he approached this classic problem, how he handled the interaction of the controls with the game physics, and what sort of tricks he employed to make Super Meat Boy feel so smooth and intuitve. From there, I’ve got a ton of other questions, ranging from how he built and maintained the art pipeline for Edmund McMillen to how he deals with the challenges of programming games entirely by himself.</p> <p><b>2:50pm - 4:05pm<br/>Mike Acton </b><br/>Next up is Mike Acton, a programmer from the other end of the team scale spectrum. Mike leads the programmers at Insomniac, the developer famous for the Ratchet and Clank series, Resistance, Fuse, and Sunset Overdrive. As he laid out in his now-famous CPPCon keynote on data-oriented design, Mike believes in focusing on the hardware and eschewing the typical OOP design methodologies common in large-scale programming.<br/>I’ve got a bunch of questions for Mike, but first and foremost I’ll be asking about his experiences managing large teams of programmers while still maintaining sane development practices. On Handmade Hero, I’m constantly asked whether practical programming techniques “scale”, and I can’t think of anyone better to answer this question than Mike.</p> <p><b>4:35pm - 5:50pm<br/>Pat Wyatt </b><br/>Kicking off part two of the con is Pat Wyatt, one of the main programmers behind some of the best-known series in gaming history: Warcraft, Diablo, StarCraft, and Guild Wars. He co-founded ArenaNET, and personally designed and programmed the core networking code for the original Guild Wars launch, one of the most robust multiplayer networking launches I’ve ever seen.<br/>On Handmade Hero, one of the most common things I get asked about that we don’t cover is network programming. If there’s one person who knows network programming for games inside and out, it’s Pat, and I have a ton of questions for him about how he approaches network architecture, both client-side and back-end.</p> <p><b>5:55pm - 7:10pm<br/>Jonathan Blow</b><br/>Next up is Jonathan Blow, lead programmer and designer of the classic platform puzzle game Braid and the massive, highly anticipated 2016 puzzle-exploration game The Witness. Looking ahead to the complexity of his future game designs, and unsatisfied with the state of C++ as a game programming language, Jon recently undertook the design and implementation of his own brand-new programming language, in which he has already demonstrated several advanced features that make C++ look like an antiquated toy.<br/>There’s so many things to talk about with Jon, it’s going to be hard to fit it all in, but I’ll do my best. We’ll talk about how he’s managed the complex programming necessary to bring his intricate puzzle designs to life, what spurred him to start working on his own programming language, and how he sees it changing the way he programs games in the future.</p> <p><b>7:15pm - 8:30pm<br/>Ron Gilbert </b><br/>Bringing the conference to a close is none other than a programming hero of mine, Ron Gilbert. Quite literally the inventor of the traditional point-and-click adventure game, Ron programmed the original SCUMM scripting language and lead the LucasArts team that created what is arguably the most beloved graphical adventure of all time, The Secret of Monkey Island. Last year, after having helmed dozens of games at big studios, Ron decided to return to his roots and write a brand-new adventure game engine for a new indie adventure series, Thimbleweed Park.<br/>When I was a kid, I played the heck out of Monkey Island (and Monkey Island 2), and as an aspiring programmer, there were so many questions I wished I could have asked Ron about how it worked. HandmadeCon is my big chance to make those wishes come true :) And it’s going to be even more illuminating now to hear about what has changed and what has stayed the same in his approach to creating an engine for the genre which he pioneered.</p> ","how_to_find_us":"The building is down the gravel drive way just behind Technology Connection.
