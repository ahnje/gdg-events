In this first virtual meetup, Tim Berry will take us through building a big data pipeline with Pub/Sub, Dataflow and BigQuery, then using it to flag naughty words in fake tweets. The meeting will take place via Zoom (sorry Google! It gives us a few more features than Hangouts). Bring your own pizza and drinks!</p> ","how_to_find_us":"https://acloudguru.zoom.us/j/92571705946","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1588059722000,"duration":7200000,"id":"270309792","name":"Community Speedrun Challenge #1:  Baseline: Data, ML, AI","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1588611600000,"local_date":"2020-05-04","local_time":"18:00","updated":1588620660000,"utc_offset":3600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":7,"venue":{"id":26906060,"name":"Online event","repinned":false,"country":"","localized_country_name":""},"is_online_event":true,"group":{"created":1532545256000,"name":"GDG Bristol","id":29351980,"join_mode":"open","lat":51.459999084472656,"lon":-2.5999999046325684,"urlname":"GDG-Bristol","who":"Members","localized_location":"Bristol, United Kingdom","state":"B7","country":"gb","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/London"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Bristol/events/270309792/","description":"<p>Hello!</p> <p>Weâ€™re sure most of you are interested in learning new technologies and tools.
