How often do we get a chance like that? While this meetup won't be strictly about Android development, it is related. Phone Gap (or Apache Cordova) lets you build an app for Android, iOS, Windows, Firefox OS, Kindle... and you write your program in Javascript and use HTML and CSS for rendering. How can that be, you ask? Joe Bowser will tell us.</p> <p><b>About the talk:</b></p> <p>The original purpose of <a href=\"http://phonegap.com\">PhoneGap</a> (see <a href=\"http://cordova.apache.org/\">Apache Cordova</a>) back in its inception in 2008 was for it to no longer be needed. The belief was that HTML/CSS and Javascript would eventually become first class citizens and would be one of the primary ways that people would develop applications. However, despite numerous changes, there is even more activity around Apache Cordova than there ever has in the past.</p> <p>This talk will go through what is possible today using HTML5, CSS and Javascript with and without Apache Cordova, what still needs work, where the future is heading, and how you can help.</p> <p>This will also cover some of the different ways that one can use Cordova, and is a good introductory talk on the differences between a pure HTML5 application, a Hybrid Application, a fully native application, and why none of these distinctions should matter to your users.</p> <p><b>Speaker:</b></p> <p>Joe Bowser<br/>Adobe Systems</p> <p>Joe is the creator of PhoneGap for Android and is the longest contributing committer to the PhoneGap and Apache Cordova projects respectively. When he is not contributing to Open Source at Adobe, he spends his spare time working on various hardware projects at home, as well as at the Vancouver Hack Space, which he co-founded.</p> <p>Please arrive by 6 pm,</p> <p>Talk to start @ 6 pm<br/>followed by discussion and open Q&amp;A</p> <p>Dinner provided.</p> ","how_to_find_us":"Please get a visitor badge from security/ reception. \n\nWe will meet in the room named \"Michelangelo\" on the same level that you enter, where main reception is.

Food is not provided at this meetup, but you are able to eat food in the conference room where we meet.</p> <p>Location info: As you come to Instructure tonight please note a few things. 1. Please park on the ground level and enter the giant glass doors. (This is the 2nd floor) Elevators are to the right. There will be no way to get into the building after 6:30. The doors will become locked. 2. Please come up to the 7th floor. From there you will walk down some stairs to the 6th floor where we will be meeting.

They can be downloaded within the SDK manager of Android Studio. Also download the Google USB driver which is also found in the SDK manager.</p> <p>There is WiFi, but these downloads are large and will take some time, so anything you can download ahead of time would be helpful. If you have an Android device, bring it along with a USB cable.</p> <p><b>Track 2: 6:15pm, discussion and open Q&amp;A</b></p> <p>We will be brainstorming ideas for an app for the group to continually develop.

Let's have some fun! This month, we're going to leave behind the CRUD apps, business logic, and daily stand-ups. We'll explore how features like real classes, comprehensive standard libraries, and syntactic sugar make Dart the perfect technology for producing browser-based games. Over the course of the meetup, we'll build a simple action game together, exploring concepts like drawing on the HTML5 canvas, random number generation, and game loops using one of the modern browsers' hottest new features, requestAnimationFrame().</p> <p>Perhaps best of all for those of you new to Dart: all the game code we write can be composed and executed in the online Dart playground, DartPad (<a href=\"http://dartpad.dartlang.org\" class=\"linkified\">http://dartpad.dartlang.org</a>). No setup required! Just bring any device that can run a modern web browser and you're good to go. Of course, if you already use a full-fledged editing environment like WebStorm, Eclipse, or Sublime Text, those will work too.</p> <p><b>Big News:</b> Dart 1.11 was released! We'll spend a few minutes talking about the changes and new features.</p> <p><b>Prizes:</b> At the end of the meet there will be a short survey.

We'll be providing food, expert help, and some prizes for attendees. This is on a Saturday, so you can count on a focused group with lots of time for questions. You'll be able to walk away with a completed smart assistant action. All skill levels are welcome, even if you just have an idea!</p> <p>We're charging to provide an excellent experience, and our organizers are volunteering their time, so no profit will be made.</p> <p>Update:<br/>We've received sponsorship from Apex Systems and are now offering a $50 AIY kit to the first 15 people to RSVP (and of course attend the event). We're continuing to talk to sponsors, so there's hopefully more to come! The AIY kits work using the same skills we'll learn and actions we build, so you'll be able to test and demonstrate your smart assistant talents anywhere! The day-long workshop includes breakfast and a catered lunch. We hope to be done by late-afternoon so you can still enjoy the rest of Saturday. The event is appropriate for all skill levels; we'll cover everything you need to know.
