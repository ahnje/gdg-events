I took a radical approach and quit my job to focus on learning to program full-time. Join me in this talk to hear about my process of setting a goal, the steps I took to achieve it, and how I ended up in New York to attend the Recurse Center in pursuit of a career as a programmer.</p> <p>• Important to know<br/>Our events are open to tech enthusiasts of all genders and ages.<br/>Code of conduct: <a href=\"https://gdgnetherlands.org/conduct\" class=\"linkified\">https://gdgnetherlands.org/conduct</a></p> <p>• About Q42<br/>Q42 is a strategic technology agency; or as we like to say, we're 80 nerds who like to make things with impact, things that make people smile.</p> <p>We've made Q42 into a place where, next to our work for clients, everyone gets room to run with their own ideas and dreams.
