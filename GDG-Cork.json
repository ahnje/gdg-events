It will demonstrate some of the key features and how they can improve the lives of developers and other users of the service. It will also cover the main frameworks for creating a GraphQL service in node.js, Java and .NET.</p> <p>&gt; Analyzing and querying large datasets using Bigquery: Johannes Ahlmann (CEO Sensatus Ltd.)</p> <p>Google Bigquery is a great offering both for datasets already hosted on BigQuery as well for your own large datasets that you wish to query quickly. I will give examples of existing datasets such as GitHub archive, Reddit posts, libraries.io, gdelt.org as well as using BigQuery for queries on a large private dataset.</p> <p>&gt; Getting started with microcontrollers and Google Cloud IoT Core: Gautier Mecling (Google Developer Expert)</p> <p>In this talk, we will start with a famous and affordable microcontroller unit. We will first discover how to write code for this MCU so we can get environment data. Then we will connect the microcontroller to the Cloud using Google Cloud IoT Core. Our goal is to discover what these online Cloud IoT solutions offer, and why you may (or may not) need those.</p> <p>&gt; Understanding Principle Component Analysis: Urja Pawar (PhD in Collaboration with MckessonStudent )</p> <p>The talk will start with why we use PCA in the data pre-processing and how it actually works. It will briefly cover methods to achieve PCA and existing libraries and list some scenarios when PCA can be helpful. In the end, there will be a small demo that can be practised by participants then and there to visualize how PCA works.</p> <p>&gt; TBA</p> <p>&gt; TBA</p> <p>Lunch will be provided.</p> <p>Tickets via Eventbrite only.</p> <p>Buy Tickets: <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/devfest-cork-2019-tickets-77722980527\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/devfest-cork-2019-tickets-77722980527</a></p> <p>Event Website : <a href=\"https://devfest.gdgcork.ie/\" class=\"linkified\">https://devfest.gdgcork.ie/</a></p> <p>If you interested in delivering a talk at DevFest submit your proposal here: <a href=\"https://forms.gle/5vZ7DVimWxcXxMSt7\" class=\"linkified\">https://forms.gle/5vZ7DVimWxcXxMSt7</a></p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false}],"upcoming":[],"organizers":[{"id":96395842,"name":"Tharindu Prabhath R.","status":"active","joined":1370354424000,"city":"Cork","country":"ie","localized_country_name":"Ireland","lat":51.9,"lon":-8.47,"photo":{"id":282805620,"highres_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/6/4/1/4/highres_282805620.jpeg","photo_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/6/4/1/4/member_282805620.jpeg","thumb_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/6/4/1/4/thumb_282805620.jpeg","type":"member","base_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com"},"group_profile":{"status":"active","visited":1575322666000,"created":1543486082000,"updated":1543613048000,"role":"organizer","group":{"id":30615466,"urlname":"GDG-Cork","name":"GDG Cork","status":"active","who":"Members","members":208,"join_mode":"open","localized_location":"Cork, Ireland"},"intro":"I'm a Co-Organizer of GDG Cork and currently a Ph.D. student at CIT.
