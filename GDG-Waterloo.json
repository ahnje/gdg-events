I will go over select basic topics from here: <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/training/index.html\"><a href=\"http://developer.android.com/training/index.html\" class=\"linkified\">http://developer.android.com/training/index.html</a></a> and one advanced topic (In-App Billing), time-permitting.</p> <p>The topics covered will be enough to put together a fully functional app, for example, my first Android app found on Google Play here:<a href=\"http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=azzam.imad.games.silhouguess2\"><a href=\"http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=azzam.imad.games.silhouguess2\" class=\"linkified\">http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=azzam.imad.games.silhouguess2</a></a></p> <p>Prerequisites:</p> <p>1- Download and install the Android SDK from here: <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html\"><a href=\"http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html\" class=\"linkified\">http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html</a></a></p> <p>2- Once installed, download the API 16 packages as follows:</p> <p>a- Open Eclipse from the SDK downloaded above</p> <p>b- Go to Window --&gt; Android SDK Manager --&gt; Select 'Android 4.1.2 (API 16)', which automatically select everything under it.</p> <p>c- Make sure everything else is not selected, click 'Install ## packages' and follow the prompts.</p> <p>3- If possible, bring an Android device running Android 4.1.2 or higher, and an appropriate USB cable. Running and debugging on a real device are much faster and convenient than the simulator.</p> <p><b>OAuth2 on Android</b></p> <p><i>From the top, down...</i></p> <p>• Android Apps on Web APIs: <a href=\"http://youtu.be/dylFNrvZ_3U\"><a href=\"http://youtu.be/dylFNrvZ_3U\" class=\"embedded\">http://youtu.be/dylFNrvZ_3U</a></a></p> <p>• Overview of OAuth2: <a href=\"http://youtu.be/YLHyeSuBspI\"><a href=\"http://youtu.be/YLHyeSuBspI\" class=\"embedded\">http://youtu.be/YLHyeSuBspI</a></a></p> <p>• Jump to Mobile: <a href=\"http://youtu.be/YLHyeSuBspI?t=28m42s\"><a href=\"http://youtu.be/YLHyeSuBspI?t=28m42s\" class=\"embedded\">http://youtu.be/YLHyeSuBspI?t=28m42s</a></a></p> <p>• Authorization on Android: <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/google/play-services/auth.html\"><a href=\"http://developer.android.com/google/play-services/auth.html\" class=\"linkified\">http://developer.android.com/google/play-services/auth.html</a></a></p> <p>• Getting started: <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/google-apps/tasks/oauth-and-tasks-on-android\"><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/.../oauth-and-tasks-on-android\" class=\"linkified\">https://developers.google.com/.../oauth-and-tasks-on-android</a></a></p> <p>• Official sample: <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/google-api-java-client/wiki/OAuth2#Android\"><a href=\"http://code.google.com/.../OAuth2#Android\" class=\"linkified\">http://code.google.com/.../OAuth2#Android</a></a></p> <p>• Unofficial sample: <a href=\"https://github.com/wareninja/generic-oauth2-login-for-android\"><a href=\"https://github.com/wareninja/generic-oauth2-login-for-android\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/wareninja/generic-oauth2-login-for-android</a></a></p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1388751065000,"duration":7200000,"id":"158379332","name":"Working with JavasCript and jQuery","rsvp_limit":40,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1392249600000,"local_date":"2014-02-12","local_time":"19:00","updated":1392258546000,"utc_offset":-18000000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":40,"venue":{"id":9769872,"name":"VeloCity Matrix Room, The Tannery","lat":43.4463005065918,"lon":-80.48363494873047,"repinned":false,"address_1":"151 Charles Street","city":"Kitchener","country":"ca","localized_country_name":"Canada","zip":"","state":"ON"},"group":{"created":1381919842000,"name":"GDG Waterloo","id":10711702,"join_mode":"open","lat":43.470001220703125,"lon":-80.5199966430664,"urlname":"GDG-Waterloo","who":"Developers","localized_location":"Waterloo, ON","state":"ON","country":"ca","region":"en_US","timezone":"Canada/Eastern"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Waterloo/events/158379332/","description":"<p>We're teaming up with GDG Toronto in our first of four parts which will culminate in a road-trip to T.O. for a hackjam!</p> <p>This first event is a primer on JavaScript and jQuery.

Below are our speakers and a description of their talks!</p> <p>Adler Santos, Data Engineer at Skywatch Space Applications<br/>Satellite imagery varies greatly in quality – some images will contain defects introduced by the environment (say your area of interest is covered in clouds) and/or by the image processing algorithm (blurs, artifacts, or gaps are introduced). One of the challenges facing Skywatch is to prevent unusable, low-quality imagery from getting to our customers. In this presentation, I'd like to discuss how we used computer vision for image quality assessment and how it has helped us consistently deliver high-quality satellite imagery to the end-user.</p> <p>Michael Jamieson, Computer Vision Researcher at SPORTLOGiQ<br/>One of the things we do at SPORTLOGiQ is visually track players in soccer and hockey games. This rich spatial context lets us better understand game events such as passes and turnovers as well as the overall flow of the game. We can track in real time using multiple fixed cameras or work directly from the broadcast feed.</p> <p>Following each talk will be a fireside Q&amp;A!</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1552445655000,"duration":7200000,"id":"259719414","name":"Women Techmakers Waterloo: Presents a Night of Celebration IWD '19","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1552946400000,"local_date":"2019-03-18","local_time":"18:00","updated":1552959474000,"utc_offset":-14400000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":7,"group":{"created":1381919842000,"name":"GDG Waterloo","id":10711702,"join_mode":"open","lat":43.470001220703125,"lon":-80.5199966430664,"urlname":"GDG-Waterloo","who":"Developers","localized_location":"Waterloo, ON","state":"ON","country":"ca","region":"en_US","timezone":"Canada/Eastern"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Waterloo/events/259719414/","description":"<p>*** This event is FREE but please RSVP here: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2CjiipZ\" class=\"linkified\">https://bit.ly/2CjiipZ</a> ***</p> <p>Google's Women Techmakers program provides visibility, community, and resources for women in technology.</p> <p>In honor of International Women's Day 2019; WTM Waterloo, will be celebrating a diverse group of Women Techmakers from the KW region and their invaluable contributions to technology.</p> <p>Kindly join us for a night of storytelling, inspiration and celebration of some remarkable local Women Techmakers!</p> <p>Our #IamRemarkable Speakers:</p> <p>Amanie Ismail: Co-Founder &amp; COO, Meya.ai<br/>Ashton Rankin: Product Manager, Vidyard<br/>Carolina Miranda:Co-Founder, Feminine Harbor &amp; Educator with WCDSB<br/>Dinah Davis: VP of R&amp;D, Arctic Wolf<br/>Davis Green: Interaction Designer<br/>Komal Singh: Program Manager at Google and Author of \"Ara The Star Engineer\"<br/>Lori Lalonde: Senior Tech Evangelist, Microsoft<br/>Lisa House: Technical Program Manager, SkyWatch<br/>Mandy Gu: Computational Linguist<br/>Mayya Sharipova: Java Search Engineer, Elastic<br/>Nicole Hu: UX Designer, ApplyBoard</p> <p>Please note we will be capturing various moments of our celebration.
