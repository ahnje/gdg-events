I will go over select basic topics from here: <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/training/index.html\"><a href=\"http://developer.android.com/training/index.html\" class=\"linkified\">http://developer.android.com/training/index.html</a></a> and one advanced topic (In-App Billing), time-permitting.</p> <p>The topics covered will be enough to put together a fully functional app, for example, my first Android app found on Google Play here:<a href=\"http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=azzam.imad.games.silhouguess2\"><a href=\"http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=azzam.imad.games.silhouguess2\" class=\"linkified\">http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=azzam.imad.games.silhouguess2</a></a></p> <p>Prerequisites:</p> <p>1- Download and install the Android SDK from here: <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html\"><a href=\"http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html\" class=\"linkified\">http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html</a></a></p> <p>2- Once installed, download the API 16 packages as follows:</p> <p>a- Open Eclipse from the SDK downloaded above</p> <p>b- Go to Window --&gt; Android SDK Manager --&gt; Select 'Android 4.1.2 (API 16)', which automatically select everything under it.</p> <p>c- Make sure everything else is not selected, click 'Install ## packages' and follow the prompts.</p> <p>3- If possible, bring an Android device running Android 4.1.2 or higher, and an appropriate USB cable. Running and debugging on a real device are much faster and convenient than the simulator.</p> <p><b>OAuth2 on Android</b></p> <p><i>From the top, down...</i></p> <p>• Android Apps on Web APIs: <a href=\"http://youtu.be/dylFNrvZ_3U\"><a href=\"http://youtu.be/dylFNrvZ_3U\" class=\"embedded\">http://youtu.be/dylFNrvZ_3U</a></a></p> <p>• Overview of OAuth2: <a href=\"http://youtu.be/YLHyeSuBspI\"><a href=\"http://youtu.be/YLHyeSuBspI\" class=\"embedded\">http://youtu.be/YLHyeSuBspI</a></a></p> <p>• Jump to Mobile: <a href=\"http://youtu.be/YLHyeSuBspI?t=28m42s\"><a href=\"http://youtu.be/YLHyeSuBspI?t=28m42s\" class=\"embedded\">http://youtu.be/YLHyeSuBspI?t=28m42s</a></a></p> <p>• Authorization on Android: <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/google/play-services/auth.html\"><a href=\"http://developer.android.com/google/play-services/auth.html\" class=\"linkified\">http://developer.android.com/google/play-services/auth.html</a></a></p> <p>• Getting started: <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/google-apps/tasks/oauth-and-tasks-on-android\"><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/.../oauth-and-tasks-on-android\" class=\"linkified\">https://developers.google.com/.../oauth-and-tasks-on-android</a></a></p> <p>• Official sample: <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/google-api-java-client/wiki/OAuth2#Android\"><a href=\"http://code.google.com/.../OAuth2#Android\" class=\"linkified\">http://code.google.com/.../OAuth2#Android</a></a></p> <p>• Unofficial sample: <a href=\"https://github.com/wareninja/generic-oauth2-login-for-android\"><a href=\"https://github.com/wareninja/generic-oauth2-login-for-android\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/wareninja/generic-oauth2-login-for-android</a></a></p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1388751065000,"duration":7200000,"id":"158379332","name":"Working with JavasCript and jQuery","rsvp_limit":40,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1392249600000,"local_date":"2014-02-12","local_time":"19:00","updated":1392258546000,"utc_offset":-18000000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":40,"venue":{"id":9769872,"name":"VeloCity Matrix Room, The Tannery","lat":43.4463005065918,"lon":-80.48363494873047,"repinned":false,"address_1":"151 Charles Street","city":"Kitchener","country":"ca","localized_country_name":"Canada","zip":"","state":"ON"},"group":{"created":1381919842000,"name":"GDG Waterloo","id":10711702,"join_mode":"open","lat":43.470001220703125,"lon":-80.5199966430664,"urlname":"GDG-Waterloo","who":"Developers","localized_location":"Waterloo, ON","state":"ON","country":"ca","region":"en_US","timezone":"Canada/Eastern"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Waterloo/events/158379332/","description":"<p>We're teaming up with GDG Toronto in our first of four parts which will culminate in a road-trip to T.O. for a hackjam!</p> <p>This first event is a primer on JavaScript and jQuery.

There already are a lot of introductory talks to the language and its extensions for use on Android. This talk will cover advancing the usage and design patterns of the language for Android development to solve larger problems. While the content is targeted at mobile development, there will be value for all Java developers interested in Kotlin.</p> <p>Prior knowledge or use of Kotlin is not required to attend this talk. Some concepts of the language will be used without introduction but they are intuitive and/or quickly learned.

One of the challenges facing Skywatch is to prevent unusable, low-quality imagery from getting to our customers.
