Cloud Run is serverless: it abstracts away all infrastructure management, so you can focus on what matters most — building great applications. It is built from Knative, letting you choose to run your containers either fully managed with Cloud Run, or in your Google Kubernetes Engine cluster with Cloud Run on GKE.</p> <p>**IMPORTANT**<br/>An RSVP here does not register you for the event.

And of course, we'll have food, drinks and some prizes! Invite your friends.</p> <p>Speaker - Martin Jeret<br/>Title: Building Flutter for iOS without a Mac<br/>Abstract: Building for iOS is always a challenge since we might not be able to run an iOS simulator if we don't have a Mac computer and configuring your Xcode project without a Mac is a real struggle. Moreover releasing apps to the app store is painful on any device. Codemagic CI/CD has been working on a VScode plugin that allows developers to connect to a remote MacOS and run your Flutter apps on an iOS simulator. You can also use the MacOS to configure your Xcode project. We're looking forward to sharing this with the community so come check it out.</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false}],"upcoming":[],"organizers":[{"id":27906282,"name":"Marcos P.","status":"active","joined":1318525824000,"city":"Los Angeles","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","state":"CA","lat":34.1,"lon":-118.33,"photo":{"id":286025060,"highres_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/1/3/c/4/highres_286025060.jpeg","photo_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/1/3/c/4/member_286025060.jpeg","thumb_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/1/3/c/4/thumb_286025060.jpeg","type":"member","base_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com"},"group_profile":{"status":"active","visited":1577719883000,"created":1563299451000,"updated":1564069544000,"role":"coorganizer","group":{"id":30831861,"urlname":"GDG-Silicon-Beach","name":"GDG Silicon Beach (Google Developers Group)","status":"active","who":"Developers","members":536,"join_mode":"open","localized_location":"Venice, CA"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Silicon-Beach/members/27906282/"},"is_pro_admin":false},{"id":48965282,"name":"Matt K.","bio":"I'm a community organizer passionate about technology and how it can be used to solve problems.","status":"active","joined":1337876748000,"city":"Los Angeles","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","state":"CA","lat":34.09,"lon":-118.34,"photo":{"id":277184549,"highres_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/e/0/5/highres_277184549.jpeg","photo_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/e/0/5/member_277184549.jpeg","thumb_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/e/0/5/thumb_277184549.jpeg","type":"member","base_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com"},"group_profile":{"status":"active","visited":1561232022000,"created":1546539754000,"updated":1546541989000,"role":"coorganizer","group":{"id":30831861,"urlname":"GDG-Silicon-Beach","name":"GDG Silicon Beach (Google Developers Group)","status":"active","who":"Developers","members":536,"join_mode":"open","localized_location":"Venice, CA"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Silicon-Beach/members/48965282/"},"is_pro_admin":false},{"id":180141602,"name":"Marsha","status":"active","joined":1414341502000,"city":"South Pasadena","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","state":"CA","lat":34.11,"lon":-118.16,"photo":{"id":282769506,"highres_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/c/1/6/2/highres_282769506.jpeg","photo_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/c/1/6/2/member_282769506.jpeg","thumb_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/c/1/6/2/thumb_282769506.jpeg","type":"member","base_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com"},"group_profile":{"status":"active","visited":1578342517000,"created":1546625452000,"updated":1546833535000,"role":"coorganizer","group":{"id":30831861,"urlname":"GDG-Silicon-Beach","name":"GDG Silicon Beach (Google Developers Group)","status":"active","who":"Developers","members":536,"join_mode":"open","localized_location":"Venice, CA"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Silicon-Beach/members/180141602/"},"is_pro_admin":false},{"id":200199335,"name":"Nicole N.","status":"active","joined":1456116070000,"city":"Culver City","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","state":"CA","lat":33.99,"lon":-118.38,"photo":{"id":254103179,"highres_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/c/6/b/highres_254103179.jpeg","photo_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/c/6/b/member_254103179.jpeg","thumb_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/c/6/b/thumb_254103179.jpeg","type":"member","base_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com"},"group_profile":{"status":"active","visited":1580327117000,"created":1565393837000,"updated":1566330365000,"role":"coorganizer","group":{"id":30831861,"urlname":"GDG-Silicon-Beach","name":"GDG Silicon Beach (Google Developers Group)","status":"active","who":"Developers","members":536,"join_mode":"open","localized_location":"Venice, CA"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Silicon-Beach/members/200199335/"},"is_pro_admin":false},{"id":224140560,"name":"James H.","bio":"Android Developer.
