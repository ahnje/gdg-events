This event is free and open to the public.</p> <p><b>About the Presentation</b></p> <p>Everyday technology is hurtling into the realm of science fiction, even magic, with new devices that are as surprising and delightful as they are useful. Developers and designers are running hard to keep up with this warp-speed pace of tech innovation, and for now, mobile devices are at the forefront. But what's next? Trends are emerging at the hazy edges of the tech universe that hint at the future of computer interfaces, including computers without interfaces at all.<br/>Designer Josh Clark, author of \"Tapworthy,\" takes you on an expedition of this final frontier. Learn how smartphones and other sensor-rich devices have changed how we approach computing, and explore how we can better design for sensors. Learn how dumber machines will make us smarter, and how our current work lays the groundwork for a future of social devices. Along the way, you'll see how games lead the fleet, how robots can help us build our software, and why post-PC computing is about far more than phones and tablets. Finally, understand how a smart approach to technology choices now will better prepare you for the future, to boldly go where no geek has gone before.</p> <p><b>About the Presenter</b></p> <p>Josh Clark is the founder of Global Moxie. Josh is a designer specializing in mobile design strategy and user experience. When he’s not building friendly interfaces, he writes about them. In Josh’s books and blog, he explores humane software, clever design and the creative process. Josh is the author of four books, including “Tapworthy: Designing Great iPhone Apps” (O’Reilly, 2010), all of which aim to help you harness technology to make your work easier, more beautiful, more awesome.<br/>Josh is a regular speaker at international technology conferences, sharing his insights about mobile strategy and designing for phones, tablets, and other emerging devices.</p> <p><b>About PhillyCHI's Sponsor</b></p> <p>Empathy Lab is a leading digital consultancy focused on driving breakthrough strategies and experiences that drive business success across web, mobile, tablet and smart TV for Fortune 500 and fast-growth organizations around the world.

In this talk we'll look at one solution to this issue - CloudMine's backend as a service offering. CloudMine lets developers focus on developing the best possible mobile or web application they can, by taking care of the boring backend details such as user accounts, object storage and security, geotagging, social integration, load balancing, handling large spikes in traffic, and backups.</p> <p><b>About John</b></p> <p>After graduating with a degree in Software Engineering from Rochester Institute of Technology in 2010, John McCarthy began working for Oracle Primavera on the frameworks and architecture team.

Expandable notifications were introduced with Jelly Bean, and there weren't many good examples. I'll cover my experience, including expandable notifications. I'll share the approach I took to backward compatibility across 3 versions of functionality, and trying to push as much as possible of the latest functionality backward.</p> <p><b>About Travis</b></p> <p>Travis has been developing professionally in Java for about 12 years. He began developing on Android in September of 2010 -- it started as a hobby after upgrading to an HTC Hero, and he's been doing it professionally at MeetMe since 2012.</p> <p> </p> <p><b>Developing Android applications with no server-side coding using a Backend-as-a-Service platform</b></p> <p><i>Mark Piller, CEO Backendless</i></p> <p>Application development is fun except when you have to write mostly the same code over and over. Create, retrieve, update delete… multiply it by the number of database tables, add transactions, thread locking and database scaling and the fun is gone. There is a better way which will help you get your application done faster at a fraction of the cost. Backend-as-a-Service platforms enable mobile and desktop developers to focus on the client-side of the applications while providing complete server-side support including persistence, user registration handling, login, logout, publish/subscribe messaging, push notifications and many more facilities. The presentation will illustrate the power of BaaS for developing Android, JS and AS applications using Backendless as an example.</p> <p><b>About Mark</b></p> <p>Mark has more than 15 years of experience in developing distributed computing applications. Prior to Backendless, Mark worked at webMethods and was responsible for architecting the company’s SOA solution. His experience includes leading the design and implementation of multiple features of Glue, a web-services platform from The Mind Electric that was acquired by webMethods, as well as senior technical positions with ObjectSpace, MCI and SABRE.

Every kid growing up will tell you the same story. \"I want to be a Football player\" or \"I want to play basketball or baseball\", and we've all heard the ambitious quote, \"I want to be a doctor\". But honestly -- growing up and hearing everyone's same old story I cringe when people say the same things now, so you can see I've chosen a different path. I’ve always wanted to challenge myself, and impact peoples' lives in any postive way. I didn't care if it was making my mom or aunt smile, or just knowing my father was proud of me. My father is a Mechanical Engineer, so I guess I'm bias when I say that engineering was always a number one choice for me, which is probably why I see myself following the path of software development. I'm in a great computer science program provided by Temple University's MESA program and the great teaching of my mentors Tariq Hook and Dean Harris. Software development just excites me. I love the idea of putting something together one day and then having it in the hands of a million people another day. It's challenging at times but it feeds my ego when I overcome obstacles, and it doesn't hurt when our success gets us invited to California to see Google and a bunch of other great software development companies. Of course, I love -- and I do mean love -- the look on peoples' faces when they see a 17-year-old co-founder of a software development company and all the things that he can do and has accomplished so far. So just follow along on my journey as I set out to impact the world, and no matter how many people that have said it before me, I'm actually in a place to do it.</p> <p> </p> <p><b>Open Mentorship Discussion</b></p> <p>Join us for an open discussion about mentorship in the community</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1371840761000,"duration":7200000,"id":"125809832","name":"Accessibility; Google Charts","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1372284000000,"local_date":"2013-06-26","local_time":"18:00","updated":1372340700000,"utc_offset":-14400000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":24,"venue":{"id":5592912,"name":"Comcast Center ","lat":39.95412826538086,"lon":-75.1684799194336,"repinned":false,"address_1":"1701 John F.

One of the touted techniques for targeting phones and tablets is the so-called \"master-detail pattern\" that shows a list of things, then details of a selected thing. However, there are many ways of implementing the master-detail pattern, hitting on other design \"hot buttons\" (do we offer horizontal swiping between details?

You were up late drinking reheated coffee at 3am pushing pixels to perfect the app store icon. You tested the swipe animation so many times you have blisters on your thumb.</p> <p>Then the day finally comes. You publish your app and anxiously check the reviews:</p> <p>★☆☆☆☆ killz the battery - Uninstall<br/>★★☆☆☆ Two stars. Two slow.<br/>★☆☆☆☆ exposes contacts over network. INSTALL AT YOUR OWN RISK!</p> <p>While the networking and data layer may not be the sexiest part of your application it is vitally important to the experience of your users. Inefficient and insecure mobile APIs can drain the battery, slow performance, and expose users to data and identity theft.</p> <p>This workshop introduces a set of 3 principles for mobile API design that will speed up performance, enable better resource management, and improve the overall user experience of your next mobile app.</p> <p><b>This event includes optional hands-on coding exercises that will require a laptop with a working development environment if you wish to follow along.</b></p> <p><img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/1/2/600_337968402.jpeg\" /></p> <p><b>Chuck Greb</b><br/><i>Sr. Software Engineer</i><br/><a href=\"http://mapzen.com/\">Mapzen</a></p> <p>Chuck is a mobile software craftsman practicing clean code, responsive design, and test-driven development.

Beginners and the tech-curious are especially encouraged to attend, as are experienced technologists who are interested in sharing their knowledge and skills while working on projects that they are passionate about.</p> <p>LadyHacks follows the model of a civic hackathon, which emphasizes creating projects for the greater good. This year’s theme is A \"Room()\" of One’s Own, inspired from Virginia Woolf's 1929 essay, A Room of One’s Own, which argued that women’s lack of access to education, financial independence and a room of their own held them back from achieving equality with men in the sphere of publishing. We encourage teams to consider what Room() should return today in order to achieve gender equity in STEM fields, and to build projects aiming to do just that.</p> <p>LadyHacks is organized and run by team of dedicated volunteers. We do charge a small entry fee of $10 to participants. One hundred percent of this admission fee will be donated to TechGirlz, a non-profit organization that encourages middle school aged girls to consider careers in technology through classes, workshops and mentorship programs.</p> <p>Want to know more?

Let's get together and discuss these recent changes and more.</p> <p>We will have (4) short presentations focusing on the topics below followed by Q&amp;A and open discussion with our speaker panel.</p> <p><b>Material Design</b><br/><i>Jason Donmoyer (AWeber)</i></p> <p>Upon first glance, Google’s Material Design spec appears massive and overwhelming.  Coupled with the recent UI rewrites coming out of Mountain View, this has many developers concerned about the impact of targeting Material Design in their existing applications.  Alleviate some of your worries and come learn about some of the important API changes introduced in Android L to help ease the transition to Material Design.</p> <p><i>Jason Donmoyer is an Android Developer at AWeber Communications and Co-founder of <a href=\"http://threddies.com/\">threddies.com</a>.  He’s a long time Java developer and an all around sound, light and chemistry tinkerer who has been involved in developing and publishing several Android applications.</i></p> <p><b>Project Volta</b><br/><i>Matt Rein (AWeber)</i></p> <p>In 2012, Android JellyBean and Project Butter aimed to replace “janky” UI interactions with snappy, 60 fps graphics across the board.  In 2013, Google announced Project Svelte, with lofty goals of ensuring the latest version of Android, KitKat, can run on traditionally underpowered devices, even those with only 512MB of RAM.  This year, in the Android L release, Google turned their focus towards one of the biggest complaints that users have about their handsets with Project Volta - battery life!  In this talk, we will go over what Project Volta really is, including the new Battery Historian tool and JobScheduler APIs which are meant to make it easier for developers to be good citizens in the Android ecosystem when it comes to device energy usage.</p> <p><i>Matt Rein is an Android Developer at AWeber Communications.  In his spare time he’s been learning to develop apps for Android Wear, as well as teaching himself the new Swift programming language for Apple’s products. </i></p> <p><b>Notifications</b><br/><i>Chuck Greb (Mapzen)</i></p> <p>Material design. Lock screen display. Public and private visibility. Heads-up! In this talk we'll explore the funky side of notifications in Android L.</p> <p><i>Chuck is an Android developer at Mapzen. He builds open source and open data tools for location-aware applications.</i></p> <p><b>Android Wear<br/></b><i>Arpit Mathur (Comcast)</i></p> <p>In this session we'll look at the Android Wear SDK for smart watches. We'll take a look at both the Rich Notification bridging and the native app support as well as discuss the user experiences for applications on Android Wear.</p> <p><i>Arpit is a Software Engineer working for Comcast Innovation Labs in Philadelphia with a long history of programming in a variety of user interface technologies including Flash, Flex, JavaScript/HTML and lately Objective C and Java for Android.

We'll look at how Google Cloud Platform enables developers when it comes to building Cloud Native applications and we'll show how support for containers fits into the big picture and provide insight into the when, why and how of using them. We'll wrap up with a cool demo of the Kubernetes Container Scheduler. </p> <p>----------------------</p> <p><b>About the Speakers</b></p> <p>Ray is a Developer Advocate for the Google Cloud Platform.  Ray had extensive hands on cross-industry enterprise systems integration delivery and management experiences during his time at Accenture, managed full stack application development, DevOps, and ITOps.  Ray specialized in middleware, big data, and PaaS products during his time at RedHat while contributing to open source projects, such as Infinispan.  Aside from technology, Ray enjoys traveling and adventures.</p> <p>Mandy works in Google Developer Relations on the Google Cloud Platform, covering App Engine, Compute Engine, Big Query and all of the data storage options that they connect to.

We'll cover the basics, where to go to learn more(or search for a specific operator), and then see some of the operators in action. I'll show how easily it integrates with Retrofit, and work through some examples using the Github API. We'll discuss practical uses for certain operators, and probably some less practical things you might consider trying. I'll also cover gotchas and mistakes, as I've made plenty.

BLE beacons give our Android applications a proximal context that allows them to hide all but the most relevant UI widgets: The user walks into a dark room, sits down on the couch, and receives a notification on her phone. This notification presents an “On” button for the overhead light in the room. Given these predictive UI widgets, the user would rarely, if ever, need to explicitly launch an application using proximal context. </p> <p>Proximal context also lets us relax certain security concerns to provide an improved user experience.

While a designer considers the aesthetics and ergonomics of a product, a developer considers the build process and the tools available for the build. Both parties (usually) have the best intentions, but too often one or both parties refuse to make adjustments to accommodate the other. In this presentation, John will cover three patterns that will hopefully ease your working relationship with your design counterpart as you build an Activity with a content feed. The three patterns address </p> <p>• Handling various network/permission view states, </p> <p>• Handling custom Views, and </p> <p>• Supporting multiple RecyclerView.ViewHolders within a RecyclerView. </p> <p>Ultimately, the three patterns strive to keep your code flexible and easy to navigate for fluctuating designs and future updates to the product.</p> <p><b>About John</b></p> <p>John is currently the lead Android developer at SnipSnap, a Philadelphia-based start-up.

When a developer embarks on implementing an app, knowing how to lay things out efficiently makes it easier to adapt one screen to any device, be it mobile, TV or a wearable. Not only can you use Android’s resource types for designing responsive apps but you can also use them to define colors, animations, drawables, layouts as well as the newly introduced fonts resource type in Android O preview! In this talk, you will learn about * the various Android resource types at your disposal<br/>* providing alternative resources when you need to support multiple devices and locales<br/>* the precedence of resource qualifiers when there are alternative resources We will go through several code samples to better understand how Android’s resource system works so that it’s easier to make implementation decisions for one design on different screens. This talk is geared towards developers as well as designers interested in knowing how their designs get translated in the Android world.</p> <p>***</p> <p>We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free environment and attendees are expected to uphold out Code of Conduct (<a href=\"https://github.com/AndroidPhilly/androidphilly.github.io\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/AndroidPhilly/androidphilly.github.io</a>).</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1503942818000,"id":"242901080","name":"September Meetup: Bluetooth on Android & Annotation Processors","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1506549600000,"local_date":"2017-09-27","local_time":"18:00","updated":1507823061000,"utc_offset":-14400000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":33,"group":{"created":1337653728000,"name":"GDG Philadelphia","id":3912952,"join_mode":"open","lat":40,"lon":-75.13999938964844,"urlname":"GDGPhilly","who":"Allies","localized_location":"Philadelphia, PA","state":"PA","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Eastern"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDGPhilly/events/242901080/","manual_attendance_count":18,"description":"<p>Agenda: <b>Please note that this month we'll begin the talks at 6:15.

I will describe the resources I'm using, I'll point out my biggest discoveries so far, and I'll walk through some code that I've converted over. Speaker Bio</p> <p>Nick DiPatri is a Principal Engineer at Comcast. He has a degree in Electrical Engineering from Rutgers and has been doing software development since he got his Timex Sinclair in ‘82. Earlier in his career, Nick developed software/firmware/hardware solutions including RF modelling, large-scale traffic sensor arrays, and N-Tier highly available Java enterprise systems. Since this whole mobile thing caught on, however, he’s been in heaven.. mostly because it lets him play with Internet of Things devices, solder and 5-minute epoxy.</p> <p>Virtual Reality</p> <p>VR promises to take user experience to the next level by freeing us from 2d displays and putting is in completely virtual worlds. However building native VR apps targeting different platforms is an expensive process. In this talk we'll take a look at the emerging WebVR standard that now is actively supported by all VR platform providers and how to use that to build VR experiences. Specifically we'll look at Mozilla's AFrame framework, ThreeJS and Blender to create immersive VR experiences.</p> <p>Speaker Bio</p> <p>Arpit Mathur is a Principal Software Engineer at Comcast Labs where he is currently working on Virtual and Augmented Reality as well as investigating Blockchains and the decentralized internet. Before CIL he was at Comcast Interactive Media where he worked on Android and iOS applications, JavaScript and Flash.

Previously he worked on Comcast's flagship mobile apps such as Cloud DVR and Xfinity Home.<br/>Recently he has been overseeing 3 teams of native iOS and Android native app development for Barclaycard in Wilmington.</p> <p>Abstract:<br/>The new Android Architecture Components announced at Google I/O 2017 is no longer in beta. In this talk, you will learn about the following components:</p> <p>ViewModel - A component to declare your data that works with your Activity or Fragments lifecycles. It will not get destroyed during configuration changes (screen orientation) and lives for the life of the app.</p> <p>LiveData - Wraps your data into an observables and allows your Activities or Fragments to register an observer and get notified when the data changes. Imagine your fragment getting notifications when changes to a database table occur. This is also a great way to communicate between fragments or Activities and Fragments.</p> <p>Room - Awesome way of creating databases, data accessors and DB entities by just annotating your POJOs that represent the DB data. All three components can be used independently or work together for a persistent solution.</p> <p>****</p> <p>• Important to know<br/>Code of conduct: <a href=\"https://github.com/AndroidPhilly/GDGPhillyStudyJam/blob/master/README.md#gdg-phillyandroid-alliance-code-of-conduct\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/AndroidPhilly/GDGPhillyStudyJam/blob/master/README.md#gdg-phillyandroid-alliance-code-of-conduct</a></p> ","how_to_find_us":"Come to the check-in desk and proclaim your affiliation with GDG Philly.","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1519221685000,"duration":7200000,"id":"248022118","name":"February Meetup: Announcements, Room and Practical Kotlin","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1519858800000,"local_date":"2018-02-28","local_time":"18:00","updated":1519936129000,"utc_offset":-18000000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":36,"venue":{"id":5592912,"name":"Comcast Center ","lat":39.95412826538086,"lon":-75.1684799194336,"repinned":false,"address_1":"1701 John F.

If so, we will be meeting virtually to do Kotlin Koans (<a href=\"https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/koans.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/koans.html</a>) together over four weeks. Kotlin Koans are a series of exercises to get you familiar with the Kotlin Syntax. Each exercise is created as a failing unit test and your job is to make it pass. At each virtual meeting we will open up a hangout, and complete 10 tasks, discussing any questions or issues that we have as we go along.</p> <p>Why learn Kotlin?<br/>Kotlin is an official language on Android. Officially supported by Google since May 2017, more and more Android developers are adopting it because of its interoperability with Java and its safety features for nullability and immutability. Who is running this workshop?<br/>This virtual workshop will be run by Audrey with support from Yash (your friendly GDG Philly organizer). Audrey is an accomplished hands-on technology leader with ten years of experience that includes software management and coding of Android, iOS, and web-based solutions. Ahead of the first meeting:<br/>* Clone the project on GitHub: git clone <a href=\"https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-koans\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-koans</a><br/>* Import the project as Gradle project to your favorite IDE<br/>* Make sure you can build the project and run tests using test task on Gradle panel.

RAIN DATE: WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 26th.</p> <p>The Super Meetup is a gathering of the most-connected members of the local tech, startup, and entrepreneurial scene. It’s a chance to make new friends and learn more about local tech and entrepreneurial resources and tech-focused meetup groups.</p> <p>The idea of the Super Meetup is simple: meetups are integral to any tech scene. Every now and then, it makes sense to rally the leaders of tech-related meetups in town and gather for one big mixer.

Appealing to users with the widest range of capabilities is the right thing to do. With TalkBack, for example, a person who is blind can use your Android app. But Android's accessibility features don't work \"out of the box\" you need to do a little more work to bring them to users. Come to this talk to learn how to support accessibility in your app.</p> <p>Talk: Build and scale serverless mobile apps with Firebase and Google Cloud<br/>Speaker: Doug Stevenson from the Firebase team<br/>If your app has millions of users, you need a backend infrastructure to support its growth. Do you want to build that infrastructure? Of course not! Your time is better spent focusing on the app. In this talk, we'll take a look at the code for a mobile app that works like a “universal translator”. It uses Firebase and Google Cloud services and APIs. And we'll do it \"serverless\" without having to manage servers or infrastructure. A live demo of the app will be done with audience participation - bring a phone or laptop!</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1563574435000,"duration":7200000,"id":"263299956","name":"Flutter Study Jam","rsvp_limit":50,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"upcoming","time":1569448800000,"local_date":"2019-09-25","local_time":"18:00","updated":1564161000000,"utc_offset":-14400000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":28,"venue":{"id":1215883,"name":"Comcast Center","lat":39.95500946044922,"lon":-75.1679916381836,"repinned":true,"address_1":"17th & Arch Streets","city":"Philadelphia","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"19103","state":"PA"},"group":{"created":1337653728000,"name":"GDG Philadelphia","id":3912952,"join_mode":"open","lat":40,"lon":-75.13999938964844,"urlname":"GDGPhilly","who":"Allies","localized_location":"Philadelphia, PA","state":"PA","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Eastern"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDGPhilly/events/263299956/","description":"<p>Flutter is Google’s portable UI kit for crafting high-quality native interfaces on iOS and Android in record time.
