Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated between them. The flexible architecture allows you to deploy computation to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device with a single API. TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain Team within Google's Machine Intelligence research organization for the purposes of conducting machine learning and deep neural networks research, but the system is general enough to be applicable in a wide variety of other domains as well.</p> <p>The annual TensorFlow DevSummit takes place on March 6-7, 2019 in the Google Event Center, Sunnyvale, California USA.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/dev-summit\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.tensorflow.org/dev-summit</a></p> <p>Let's watch together the video/livestream of the 2019 TensorFlow Dev Summit.</p> <p>Agenda</p> <p>03:00: Meet and Greet/ Networking</p> <p>03:30: Introduction</p> <p>03:50: Executive keynote live stream</p> <p>05:10: Discussion about executive keynote live stream &amp; lightning talks</p> <p>05:30: Dinner, wrap-up</p> <p>It's gonna be a pizza party and free GDG swags will be available.</p> ","how_to_find_us":"The meeting would take place on the 3rd floor of the library.
