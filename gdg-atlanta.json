In 2006, Google developed Linux container technology that enabled world leading fleet utilization, efficiency and scale. More recently, these same core technologies formed the foundation of Docker, the popular, new open source container environment. Join us in this session and see how containers are re-making the cloud computing landscape. Learn how Google Cloud Platform is making itself the best place in the world to run container images.</p> <p>Come see how containers and Google Cloud Platform make it easier to build, run and maintain distributed systems, by building on the same core container technologies that power all of Google. Get a tour of Kubernetes, the new open source container cluster management implementation that turns these concepts into reality. Come learn how containers and Google Cloud Platform make the technology and application architectures that power Google available to all developers across the world.</p> <p>Speaker Bio:<br/>James Chittenden is a cloud solutions engineer based in Atlanta on the Google Cloud Platform team.

Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated between them. The flexible architecture allows you to deploy computation to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device with a single API. TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain Team within Google's Machine Intelligence research organization for the purposes of conducting machine learning and deep neural networks research, but the system is general enough to be applicable in a wide variety of other domains as well. </p> <p><b>Robotics and Machine Learning Meetup </b><br/>This is a group for people to geek out about robots and build them.

It’s an awesome platform and its open source code, which can be used on various different devices, has made it a popular choice for many projects and applications. That said, for developers, Android does have one Achilles heel: Java. The release of Kotlin 1.0 offers a compelling alternative. But, it is a good idea to use it? Let’s take a tour of Kotlin with code samples, cat pictures, and a little bit of live coding. Learn how to put your codebase on a diet and improve its readability by converting your existing classes to Kotlin. See how you can improve your code quality by using the built-in null safety, and how to make unit testing more pleasurable by using the Spek framework. Along the way, we’ll share tips and tricks for using Kotlin in production apps. By the end of this talk you’ll have enough knowledge to confidently start to use Kotlin in your Android projects.</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1477957441000,"duration":28800000,"fee":{"accepts":"cash","amount":25,"currency":"USD","description":"per person","label":"price","required":false},"id":"235254292","name":"DevFest 2016","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1478962800000,"local_date":"2016-11-12","local_time":"10:00","updated":1479258285000,"utc_offset":-18000000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":17,"venue":{"id":23673429,"name":"General Assembly Atlanta","lat":33.77222442626953,"lon":-84.36607360839844,"repinned":false,"address_1":"675 Ponce de Leon Ave NE 2nd Floor ","city":"Atlanta","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"","state":"GA"},"group":{"created":1370037626000,"name":"GDG Atlanta","id":8727792,"join_mode":"open","lat":33.7400016784668,"lon":-84.37999725341797,"urlname":"gdg-atlanta","who":"GDG Atlanta Members","localized_location":"Atlanta, GA","state":"GA","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Eastern"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdg-atlanta/events/235254292/","description":"<p>GDG Atlanta is hosting a one-day developer conference on <b>Saturday, November 12 </b>from <b>10am to 6pm</b> at <a href=\"https://generalassemb.ly/atlanta\">General Assembly PCM</a>.

The first talk, presented by <b>Riaz Virani</b>, comes from Riaz's experiences as a CTO using Javascript across platforms in his strategic development planning. The second talk will be presented by <b>Andrew Levine</b>, who's a Google Cloud Platform engineer, and will feature an overview of Google's Machine Learning platform.</p> <p>--</p> <p><b>FIRST TALK : Javascript Everywhere </b><br/>JavaScript has arguably the most dynamic and fastest-moving ecosystem of any programming language. While that can lead to tool/library fatigue, it also leads to extraordinary possibilities. Today, you can use JavaScript to write production-ready applications for mobile, desktop, voice, and even IOT platforms. During this talk, we'll talk about the various tools in the ecosystem to build these applications and the trajectory of the ecosystem going forward. </p> <p><b>Bio: </b> <br/>Riaz Virani has been helping build software for 7 years. Currently, he serves at the CTO and Lead Developer at Load Up Technologies in the Atlanta area. While Ruby is his original love, the exciting developments in JavaScript always beckon his curiosity. Riaz is also an avid movie and history buff. </p> <p><img src=\"https://a248.e.akamai.net/secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/6/e/9/600_459350921.jpeg\" /></p> <p>--</p> <p><b>SECOND TALK : Google's Machine Learning Platform<br/></b>Learn the fundamentals of how computers derive actionable insight from raw data, and how companies are using this powerful technology with an <b>introductory overview of Google's Machine Learning platform</b>. We will discuss TensorFlow - the Open Source Machine Learning Library, Google's Cloud ML platform, and the pre-trained models currently available to developers. Finally, we will wrap up with some examples of how Machine Learning has been implemented in real applications. </p> <p><b>Bio:</b><br/>This month's talk is presented by Andrew Levine, who is a Google Customer Engineer based out of Atlanta, GA. He specializes in bringing Google's Cloud Platform and GSuite products to developers in the Southeast United States.

Lance previously worked as a Java developer and architect for Kodak, CNN, and GE. He regularly speaks about Ruby, wearables, and Google technologies at conferences worldwide and is the co-organizer of the Atlanta Google Developer Group, Atlanta GDG DevFest, Atlanta Sensors and Startups Meetup, Ruby DCamp ZA, and Rubyfuza, the only Ruby conference in Africa. He is known to practice interspecies pair (purr) programming with his orange tabby, Allie, and when he’s not writing code, Lance may be found diving with sharks, trekking through Chernobyl, sampling wine, cheering on the Springboks, or perfecting his biltong recipe.</p> <p><b>Intro to Tensorflow</b></p> <p>A introduction to Tensorflow. </p> <p>Lately, it seems that all of tech is abuzz about machine learning and AI. But, for many of us, just thinking about tensors and neural networks makes us tense, because it seems so mathematical. In this talk, we’ll take a look at Google’s TensorFlow and introduce machine learning in a straightforward and easy-to-understand way.  </p> <p><b>Speakers:</b></p> <p>Marlene Jaeckel fell in love with software development during her first year at the University of Pretoria in South Africa, even though she was actually a business major. After moving to California in 2001, she worked on web applications and database systems until she decided to pursue her lifelong dream of a career in medicine. Along the way, however, she realized that her true passion lies in connecting technology and healthcare, which is why she now loves to work with wearables, sensors, and smart devices as a member of the mobile development team at Polyglot Programming.

Using the built inSqliteDatabase and SqliteOpenHelper objects are often tedious and hard tounderstand. To help developers implement database persistance more easily,Google has released a new library called Room.</p> <p>It promises to simplify database implementations by providing an abstractionlayer over SQLite. In this talk we'll take a look at how to add the androidcomponents to your application, how to setup your models to get stored, how toaccess your data, and how you can test your database.</p> <p>## Bio</p> <p>Brian Gardner is an Android developer and instructor at Big Nerd Ranch. He movedto Atlanta to attend Georgia Tech for Aerospace Engineering but the Matlab classsparked an interest in programming. From there he changed to Computer Scienceand learned Ruby and Rails on the side. Shortly after graduating he discoveredAndroid development and hasn't looked back since. He's a big believer in testingand how different architecture patterns can help improve testability. When he'snot programming he can be found catching up on his reading backlog, playing pcgames, cooking, making cocktails, and finding new things to learn.</p> <p><b>From <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/groups/\"><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/groups/\" class=\"linkified\">https://developers.google.com/groups/</a></a> ::</b></p> <p>\"Google Developer Groups (GDGs) are for developers who are interested in Google's developer technology; everything from the Android, Chrome, Drive, and Google Cloud platforms, to product APIs like the Cast API, Maps API, and YouTube API. <i>A GDG can take many forms</i> -- from just a few people getting together to watch our latest video, to large gatherings with demos and tech talks, to events like code sprints and hackathons.

Knowing how to develop software that interfaces with hardware via a mobile device is a skill every mobile developer should possess. Fortunately, many open source hardware solutions exist such as Arduino, Raspberry PI, RedBoard and a few others, which provides developers an opportunity to cultivate a thorough understanding of electronics and learn how to integrate them using software. This discussion will focus on Arduino since it is the most prominent of these solutions.</p> <p>Bryan Richardson is a native of Atlanta, Georgia. After graduating from Morehouse College with a degree in economics, he became interested in software development and currently works as an Android software engineer at stable|kernel, an Atlanta mobile app development company. He is passionate about coding and relishes creating robust, refined and exciting projects of the mobile industry.

This month we are proud to welcome Jeremy Likness back, as we move into our new Home at WeWork Buckhead, for his talk:</p> <p>Introduction to Docker Containers and Orchestration in the Cloud</p> <p>Docker is the de facto tool for creating containerized applications, but leveraging containers in production isn't always straightforward. There are many options from simple hosts to complex orchestration tools. In this session you will learn about containers. You will discover hands-on how to create Docker images, load them to a custom registry and deploy them at scale with a simple example application written in Go and JavaScript. Finally, you will see orchestration in action with examples of cloud deployments implemented with Azure Container Instances, Web Apps for Containers, and Azure Kubernetes Services.</p> <p>Jeremy Likness, Cloud Developer Advocate at Microsoft</p> <p>Jeremy is a Cloud Developer Advocate for Azure at Microsoft. Jeremy wrote his first program in 1982, was recognized in the \"who's who in Quake\" list for programming the first implementation of \"Midnight Capture the Flag\" in Quake C and has been developing enterprise applications for 25 years with a primary focus on web-based delivery of line of business applications. Jeremy is the author of four technology books, a former 8-year Microsoft MVP for Developer Tools and Technologies, is an international speaker and writes regularly on cloud and container development. Jeremy follows a 100% plant-based diet and spends most of his free time running, hiking and camping, and playing 9-ball and one pocket.</p> <p>Meetup format :<br/>7:00 - Networking<br/>7:30 - Talk<br/>8:15 - Open discussion<br/>8:45 - Wrap up</p> <p>Parking: Please park in Tower Place 100 or Buckhead Tower Parking.
