IWD is an important moment to recognize how women have influenced the tech industry and beyond. So join the efforts and celebrate the contributions of women in tech, from Ada Lovelace to Grace Hopper and to thousands of other women including Googlers. This is going to be a unique experience of appreciating, showcasing and empowering women into technology.</p> <p>Having the international umbrella of #TogetherWeRise, we invite our community to share and hear about each other's super power. This year's topic is Women Leadership in Tech and with a common goal to create spaces where women in tech can find community, inspiration and empowerment, we have planned the following agenda for IWD Yerevan 2020:<br/>- Tech women shining through history,<br/>- Keynote speakers in leadership,<br/>- Live programming activity,<br/>- Startup Demo with female founders,<br/>- Networking and reception.</p> <p>More details on the program and speakers, will come soon, so you just need to register and follow us. By the way, entrance is free and open for male and female participants, but registration is mandatory via the following link - <a href=\"http://bit.ly/IWDYerevan2020-reg\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/IWDYerevan2020-reg</a>. After filling in all available seats, we'll have to put you on the waiting list.</p> <p>Meanwhile, during the whole event and even beyond it, there will be job fair for diversity! Company booths will present their vacancies open to hire particularly female candidates. To participate in the fair, companies should register first.
