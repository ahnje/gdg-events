This is a FREE 12-hour bootcamp [9:00 am - 4:00 pm] spread over two days.</p> <p>Professional trainers will teach you how to use python effectively. This workshop explores Python's place in the scientific ecosystem, and how the language, with several readily available open-source libraries, can serve as a powerful tool for data analysis.</p> <p>Why Python for Data Science is Important?</p> <p>Python is a general-purpose programming language that is becoming more and more popular for doing data science. It is often the choice for developers who need to apply statistical techniques or data analysis in their work, or for data scientists whose tasks need to be integrated with web apps or production environments. In particular, Python really shines in the field of machine learning. Its combination of machine learning libraries and flexibility makes Python uniquely well-suited to developing sophisticated models and prediction engines that plug directly into production systems.</p> <p>One of Python’s greatest assets is its extensive set of libraries. Libraries are sets of routines and functions that are written in a given language. A robust set of libraries can make it easier for developers to perform complex tasks without rewriting many lines of code.</p> <p>What’s the Job Market for Data Scientists Like?</p> <p>With millions of worldwide job openings in Big Data, the role of a data scientist has become the hottest job of the decade. In today’s data-based world, companies are using the insights that data scientists provide to stay one step ahead of their competition while keeping overhead costs low. Big names like Oracle, Apple, Microsoft, Booz Allen Hamilton, State Farm, Walmart, and more all regularly have job postings for data scientists.</p> <p>According to Forbes, for most of 2016, there were an average of 2,900 unique job postings for data scientists each month. According to a McKinsey Global Institute study, it’s predicted that by 2018, there will be almost 200,000 open positions.</p> <p>What are the Topics Covered?</p> <p>Basics: Variables and Elementary Types, Operations, Console and Functions</p> <p>Data Structures: Tuples, Lists, Sets, Dictionaries/Maps</p> <p>Control flow statements: if, for, break, continue and else statements, while loops</p> <p>File handling: File I/O and context managers</p> <p>Exception handling: try, except and finally statements, handling and raising exceptions.</p> <p>Who Can Attend?</p> <p>If you have a desire to learn new things, have a programming background/</p> <p>Who's Teaching?</p> <p>For the last 25 years, Venkatesh has been working in various domains and various technologies with DATA as a common theme.

Libraries are sets of routines and functions that are written in a given language. A robust set of libraries can make it easier for developers to perform complex tasks without rewriting many lines of code.</p> <p>What are the Topics Covered?</p> <p>Basics: Variables and Elementary Types, Operations, Console and Functions</p> <p>Data Structures: Tuples, Lists, Sets, Dictionaries/Maps</p> <p>Control flow statements: if, for, break, continue and else statements, while loops</p> <p>File handling: File I/O and context managers</p> <p>Exception handling: try, except and finally statements, handling and raising exceptions.</p> <p>Who Can Attend?</p> <p>If you have a desire to learn new things, have a programming background/</p> <p>*** Breakfast, Lunch &amp; Snacks Included!</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1547156828000,"duration":34200000,"id":"257970085","name":"GDG Cloud Fremont Dev Fest 2018 [Blockchain Academic Track] CROSSPOST**","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1549731600000,"local_date":"2019-02-09","local_time":"09:00","updated":1549768986000,"utc_offset":-28800000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":104,"venue":{"id":26131372,"name":"The Blockchain University","lat":37.508724212646484,"lon":-121.96063232421875,"repinned":true,"address_1":"4580 Auto Mall Pkwy","city":"Fremont","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"94538","state":"CA"},"is_online_event":false,"group":{"created":1535088590000,"name":"Google Developer Group Cloud (GDG) - Silicon Valley","id":29612249,"join_mode":"open","lat":37.40999984741211,"lon":-122.08000183105469,"urlname":"GDGValley","who":"Peers","localized_location":"Mountain View, CA","state":"CA","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Pacific"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDGValley/events/257970085/","description":"<p>In this workshop we will introduce developers to blockchain technology space and opportunities to get started.

The web has become so much more powerful in what we can do, though. JavaScript frameworks allow developers to build a powerful web app with a fraction of the time and resources of native apps. While tools like Ionic are allowing developers to make beautiful web apps that look and behave so much like native application with their UI and offline capabilities; so much so that users might not even tell the difference. Even cooler is now you can install apps from the web onto your phone like a native app.</p> <p>The web is advancing at an unprecedented rate, and you should be taking advantage of this. Learn what makes a progressive web app so progressive and some of the tooling you can use to build amazing (web) apps!</p> <p>Vikram Tiwari: Cloud Run and AutoML Tables @Vikram_Tiwari</p> <p>Serverless compute and ML on Google Cloud using Cloud Run and AutoML.</p> <p>Building scalable web and data platforms for high availability, resilience, and security.

Many people think programming is hard and they fail to learn. In fact, programming is easy but learning how to code is hard.</p> <p>Let's change that. Bring your laptop and get hands-on with Amit for a fun-filled event.</p> <p>No boring \"hello world\" type programming lectures and endless theories. You will actually do things and apply the stuff you learn. Yes, that is the difference.</p> <p>What You'll Learn:</p> <p>1st hour:</p> <p>You will learn how to work with ordered data, structured data, functions, modules and much more and start writing code immediately.</p> <p>2nd hour:</p> <p>Introduction to NumPy</p> <p>NumPy arrays – creation, methods, and attributes and how to Vectorize Operations with NumPy.</p> <p>3rd hour:</p> <p>We'll dive into Pandas, its capabilities, and its importance in the Python data science stack.</p> <p>We will get real-life data from IBM Watson and use it to create a data frame.</p> <p>You will be using Matplotlib for visualization. The goal is for you to be actually writing code using real-world data from IBM Watson and Kaggle.</p> <p>4th hour:</p> <p>You will be writing jaw-dropping code to create a data frame using data from Kaggle competition (<a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/competitions\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.kaggle.com/competitions</a>.)</p> <p>About the instructor:</p> <p>Amit Sarkar -</p> <p>\"For the past 15 years, I worked literally as a hub of the software development process, making sure the right people are given the right information to do their jobs.
