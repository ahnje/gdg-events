This is a FREE 12-hour bootcamp [9:00 am - 4:00 pm] spread over two days.</p> <p>Professional trainers will teach you how to use python effectively. This workshop explores Python's place in the scientific ecosystem, and how the language, with several readily available open-source libraries, can serve as a powerful tool for data analysis.</p> <p>Why Python for Data Science is Important?</p> <p>Python is a general-purpose programming language that is becoming more and more popular for doing data science. It is often the choice for developers who need to apply statistical techniques or data analysis in their work, or for data scientists whose tasks need to be integrated with web apps or production environments. In particular, Python really shines in the field of machine learning. Its combination of machine learning libraries and flexibility makes Python uniquely well-suited to developing sophisticated models and prediction engines that plug directly into production systems.</p> <p>One of Python’s greatest assets is its extensive set of libraries. Libraries are sets of routines and functions that are written in a given language. A robust set of libraries can make it easier for developers to perform complex tasks without rewriting many lines of code.</p> <p>What’s the Job Market for Data Scientists Like?</p> <p>With millions of worldwide job openings in Big Data, the role of a data scientist has become the hottest job of the decade. In today’s data-based world, companies are using the insights that data scientists provide to stay one step ahead of their competition while keeping overhead costs low. Big names like Oracle, Apple, Microsoft, Booz Allen Hamilton, State Farm, Walmart, and more all regularly have job postings for data scientists.</p> <p>According to Forbes, for most of 2016, there were an average of 2,900 unique job postings for data scientists each month. According to a McKinsey Global Institute study, it’s predicted that by 2018, there will be almost 200,000 open positions.</p> <p>What are the Topics Covered?</p> <p>Basics: Variables and Elementary Types, Operations, Console and Functions</p> <p>Data Structures: Tuples, Lists, Sets, Dictionaries/Maps</p> <p>Control flow statements: if, for, break, continue and else statements, while loops</p> <p>File handling: File I/O and context managers</p> <p>Exception handling: try, except and finally statements, handling and raising exceptions.</p> <p>Who Can Attend?</p> <p>If you have a desire to learn new things, have a programming background/</p> <p>Who's Teaching?</p> <p>For the last 25 years, Venkatesh has been working in various domains and various technologies with DATA as a common theme.

A robust set of libraries can make it easier for developers to perform complex tasks without rewriting many lines of code.</p> <p>What are the Topics Covered?</p> <p>Basics: Variables and Elementary Types, Operations, Console and Functions</p> <p>Data Structures: Tuples, Lists, Sets, Dictionaries/Maps</p> <p>Control flow statements: if, for, break, continue and else statements, while loops</p> <p>File handling: File I/O and context managers</p> <p>Exception handling: try, except and finally statements, handling and raising exceptions.</p> <p>Who Can Attend?</p> <p>If you have a desire to learn new things, have a programming background/</p> <p>*** Breakfast, Lunch &amp; Snacks Included!</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1547156828000,"duration":34200000,"id":"257970085","name":"GDG Cloud Fremont Dev Fest 2018 [Blockchain Academic Track] CROSSPOST**","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1549731600000,"local_date":"2019-02-09","local_time":"09:00","updated":1549768986000,"utc_offset":-28800000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":104,"venue":{"id":26131372,"name":"The Blockchain University","lat":37.508724212646484,"lon":-121.96063232421875,"repinned":true,"address_1":"4580 Auto Mall Pkwy","city":"Fremont","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"94538","state":"CA"},"group":{"created":1535088590000,"name":"Google Developer Group Cloud (GDG) - Silicon Valley","id":29612249,"join_mode":"open","lat":37.40999984741211,"lon":-122.08000183105469,"urlname":"GDGValley","who":"Peers","localized_location":"Mountain View, CA","state":"CA","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Pacific"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDGValley/events/257970085/","description":"<p>In this workshop we will introduce developers to blockchain technology space and opportunities to get started.

The web has become so much more powerful in what we can do, though. JavaScript frameworks allow developers to build a powerful web app with a fraction of the time and resources of native apps. While tools like Ionic are allowing developers to make beautiful web apps that look and behave so much like native application with their UI and offline capabilities; so much so that users might not even tell the difference. Even cooler is now you can install apps from the web onto your phone like a native app.</p> <p>The web is advancing at an unprecedented rate, and you should be taking advantage of this. Learn what makes a progressive web app so progressive and some of the tooling you can use to build amazing (web) apps!</p> <p>Vikram Tiwari: Cloud Run and AutoML Tables @Vikram_Tiwari</p> <p>Serverless compute and ML on Google Cloud using Cloud Run and AutoML.</p> <p>Building scalable web and data platforms for high availability, resilience, and security.
