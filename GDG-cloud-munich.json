To give me the competitive edge I've built a machine vision model that runs on an Edge TPU that keeps me informed about the dangerous vehicles that are behind me in blistering real time. I'll show you the end-to-end process of developing and deploying the model to the recently released Edge TPU hardware from Google.</p> <p>Zack is a developer advocate for Cloud Machine Learning at Google. When he’s not teaching machine learning at Google, he likes to teach machine learning at his hands-on data science meetup, Central London Data Science Project Nights. Although he works in the cloud, most of his hobby projects look at different ways you can embed machine learning into low-power devices like Raspberry Pis and Arduinos. He also likes to have a bit of banter with his mixed tag rugby teams.</p> <p>🔘 Polong Lin – Machine learning at scale with BigQuery, Colab and AI Platform notebooks on Google Cloud</p> <p>How can data scientists scale their machine learning pipelines with minimal data engineering overhead? Polong Lin (Developer Advocate, Google) will discuss how BigQuery ML, Colab and AI Platform can be used together to help businesses accelerate their growth with data.</p> <p>Polong is a Developer Advocate at Google, based in London, UK, with a focus on data science and machine learning.
