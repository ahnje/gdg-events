This is an individual competition (no teams). Searching the Internet for answers and using code snippets for existing code is acceptable (within reason).</p> <p>The Entrants will designate their level of proficiency based of the following guidelines:</p> <p>Novice: has played with Android before, but hasn’t released any apps to any app store. Intermediate: some experience with Android, programmer by day, has released an app or two. Advanced: lots of exposure to Android, Android developer as full-time job, has released multiple app There will be 3 - 4 judges who will make the rounds after 9:00 and view each app as it is presented on the contestant’s phone or emulator. Contestants will need to show what achievements have been completed.</p> <p>To be strongly considered for a top prize, a contestant must complete at least the basic achievement for his or her level, with the basic achievements being cumulative, i.e. intermediate contestants should complete the novice and intermediate basic achievements.</p> <p>This is not a teaching event.

Here's your chance to play with Android. This one is on a Tuesday due to timing with the speaker.</p> <p>Presentation details:<br/>Xamarin enables developers to create native iOS, Android, and Mac apps in C# and share code across all platforms while providing 100% API coverage on each platform. In this session we will go over all of the products on the Xamarin platform including the development tools and how they work under the hood to leverage the .NET framework in iOS, Android, and Mac apps. We will dive into creating Android apps in C# inside of Xamarin Studio &amp; Visual Studio comparing how it would be done in Java and build our first Android app in C#. We will cover how to design user interfaces with Xamarin and how to add rich functionality with pre-built components. To finish it off we will cover how to share the code we wrote to reach over 2.6 Billion devices running other platforms such as iOS and Windows. Bio:<br/>James Montemagno is a Developer Evangelist at Xamarin and Android Fanboy. He has been a .NET developer for over a decade working in a wide range of industries including game development, printer software, and web services.

In this talk I will explore some examples of well implemented web animations with the purpose of demonstrating the benefits that animations bring to the users, the importance of animating responsibly and how to communicate animations across teams. My goal is to convey to the audience that animations are more than just a decorative they make web interfaces more usable.</p> <p>Vanessa was born and raised in Colombia and moved to sunny Miami 12 years ago. Vanessa went to school at the Art Institute of Fort Lauderdale for graphic design. In 2016 she decided to follow a new passion for web development and moved to Dallas to attend DevMountain. She currently works at Alkami Technology.</p> <p>* Women, Programming, and the History of Computing, with Lucy McGuigan*</p> <p>This presentation will explore the history of women’s contributions to programming and computer science. Figures discussed will include notable contributors from “first programmer” Ada Lovelace and her revolutionary ideas about the applications of the Analytical Engine, to the women programmers of the 1940s (such as Grace Hopper, and the women programmers of ENIAC and UNIVAC), to programmers of the 1960s and 1970s (like Elizabeth \"Jake\" Feinler of ARPANET) who made critical contributions to the field. The talk will touch upon shifts in gender demographics within the field over time to re-examine the historical narrative of women in programming.</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1550703333000,"duration":7200000,"id":"259138532","name":"React Native vs. Flutter -The same app written for both platforms with Rap Payne","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1552608000000,"local_date":"2019-03-14","local_time":"19:00","updated":1552936724000,"utc_offset":-18000000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":63,"venue":{"id":24740629,"name":"Bottle Rocket Studios","lat":32.94953155517578,"lon":-96.82414245605469,"repinned":true,"address_1":"14841 Dallas Pkwy","address_2":"Suite 800","city":"Addison","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"75254","state":"TX"},"group":{"created":1298934752000,"name":"GDG Dallas","id":1791179,"join_mode":"open","lat":33,"lon":-96.83999633789062,"urlname":"gdgdallas","who":"GDG Dallas members","localized_location":"Dallas, TX","state":"TX","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Central"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdgdallas/events/259138532/","manual_attendance_count":40,"description":"<p>We can talk about theoretical differences all day.

You may also know something about GCP, the Google Cloud Platform, a suite of cloud products featuring virtual machines, data storage, networking, security, and machine learning APIs. While they appear to be disparate product groups, what you may NOT know is that behind each of the G Suite apps is a developer API, and that both GCP &amp; G Suite can be used together to build powerful solutions. At the end of the day, it's not about the tech... it's about what problems you can solve with it.
