This talk will teach developers the basics of structuring, writing and running Robotium Android System Tests. We will go over things like setting up and bootstrapping Robotium, the mechanics of writing tests, some do's and don'ts for proper System testing and last but not least why System Testing should be apart of your testing strategy.</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1391473421000,"duration":10800000,"id":"164341062","name":"Glass Developer Office Hours - RSVP on Google+","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1391637600000,"local_date":"2014-02-05","local_time":"16:00","rsvp_open_offset":"PT15M","updated":1391648608000,"utc_offset":-21600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":1,"venue":{"id":11075162,"name":"Capital Factory","lat":30.268613815307617,"lon":-97.74048614501953,"repinned":false,"address_1":"16th floor, 701 Brazos Street","city":"Austin","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"78701","state":"Te"},"group":{"created":1346725396000,"name":"Google Developer Group Austin","id":4759652,"join_mode":"open","lat":30.270000457763672,"lon":-97.73999786376953,"urlname":"gdgaustin","who":"Developers","localized_location":"Austin, TX","state":"TX","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Central"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdgaustin/events/164341062/","description":"<p>To attend this event you need to RSVP on Google+ at <a href=\"http://goo.gl/gj8VmO\"><a href=\"http://goo.gl/gj8VmO\" class=\"linkified\">http://goo.gl/gj8VmO</a></a></p> <p>Developer office hours will help you kickstart, work through, or accelerate your Glass project.

I thought it would be fun to learn something new, but was surprised by how much more productive this new tool made me. In this talk you will learn about Kotlin, my experience writing a real production app in it, and why you should give it serious consideration.</p> <p>Kotlin is a language developed by JetBrains for the JVM. It includes language features such as lambdas, data classes, extension methods and null safety, that will make even the best developer write more accurate, easier to read and maintain code.
