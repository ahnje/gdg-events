She will present an overview of Google's take on operating systems for low power IoT devices and the opportunities it brings.</p> <p>• <b>Bogdan Doinea</b> - IoT Systems Engineer, Cisco</p> <p>Join Bogdan in a session open to anyone interested in understanding the market, technical architectures, standards and entrepreneurship opportunities. The term \"IoT\" suffered from a lot of buzzwording, but it also produced important technological movements in most major business ecosystems, from agriculture and smart city to oil&amp;gas, smart grid and transportation. Bogdan's presentation lies between business and technical, analyzing architectures, from connecting industrial machinery to the network, wireless sensor networks and edge storage to AEP platforms and real-time analysis, identifying key players at each step. The beauty of IoT is that it is such a vast field that it needs the collaboration of different companies with different technologies in order to produce a business outcome.</p> <p>• <b>Andrei Voinescu</b> - CTO, Woogie</p> <p>Aliens by Daria is romanian hardware startup building Woogie, a voice-activated AI-based learning companion for kids.
