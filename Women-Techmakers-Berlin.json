As a lead developer on some of the largest web products he learned that knowledge is not enough without teamwork and good handover. He dedicated most of his time since on educating, writing and sharing, presenting on average at 30 conferences a year.

Furthermore, with a large shortage of developers, companies need to find innovative ways to recruit, and Honeypot solves these dilemmas. Before a developer gets accepted to Honeypot, there is a short verification process that includes a code review from open source contributions, such as GitHub, or with an additional coding challenge. This ensures a baseline quality level to every developer on the platform, which makes the search process more efficient for employers. On the other end, developers are able to select the interviews, offers and contracts according to their needs. The user profiles on the platform focus on these details and include a desired salary, location, information about preferred languages and even an option to work remote. Instead of the traditional process of applying to potential employers, at Honeypot companies apply to developers. This platform offers developers and companies a frictionless way to connect with each other in order to find the best match.

Take your phone for example, and the challenge faced by product designers in updating hardware and software to continuously satisfy our demands for the latest surprise. How do we decide which of the two is more important? How do we ensure neither takes centre stage, but both marry together to complement one other?<br/>We’re gathering together to discuss what it takes to build successful hardware and software products.

It assumes that you know basic concepts of (object oriented) programming but we will start from the beginner level and build up. So, the more programming experience, the better — but total newbies are also welcome, provided that they invest the required amount of time for self-learning.</p> <p>The course is designed around open-source technologies, so a Unix-like system, Linux or MacOS is preferred. Git and Visual Studio Code will be our main tools, along with Node.js. Windows is not preferred, but if you absolutely have to live on Windows, you should have a working git and Node.js installation, and the rest will work.</p> <p><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Unofficial_JavaScript_logo_2.svg/1200px-Unofficial_JavaScript_logo_2.svg.png\" /></p> <p>FAQ<br/>- #js-crash-course on our slack<br/>- Some previous programming knowledge would be really useful<br/>- It's completely free<br/>- It's both for beginners and not-so beginners<br/>- Ideally you'll keep working on your project at home<br/>- We are meeting every WEDNESDAY until 5th of December<br/>- The meetups at the Eurostaff office<br/>- There will be drinks and snacks<br/>- All genders are welcome<br/>- RSVP opens one week in advance</p> <p>About our Head of Instructors<br/>Armagan is a software architect from Berlin and currently works as the Head of Software Engineering at unu GmbH.</p> <p>Following the software craftsmanship philosophy, he has taught over 40 young engineering graduates on software and helped them enter the software industry.</p> <p>For the last five years, he has been focusing on distributed cloud architectures and developed among many others an open-source framework, cote.js, for building microservices with Node.js.</p> <p>Follow Armagan on twitter.com/dashersw, <a href=\"https://github.com/dashersw\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/dashersw</a> or on his own blog <a href=\"https://arm.ag\" class=\"linkified\">https://arm.ag</a>.</p> <p>About Women Techmakers</p> <p><img src=\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/5/0/f/600_459373583.jpeg\" /><br/>Apart from programming courses, we organize workshops on topics like Public Speaking, React, Angular, Google Assistant and Fireside Chats with companies supporting diversity in Berlin’s tech ecosystem.</p> <p>Slack <a href=\"http://slack.wtmberlin.com\" class=\"linkified\">http://slack.wtmberlin.com</a> #js-crash-course<br/>Facebook Page: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/WomenTechmakersBerlinPage/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.facebook.com/WomenTechmakersBerlinPage/</a><br/>Facebook Group: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/1106085959408694/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.facebook.com/groups/1106085959408694/</a><br/>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WTM_berlin\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/WTM_berlin</a><br/>Meetup: www.meetup.com/women-Techmakers-Berlin/</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1541614168000,"duration":5400000,"id":"256210217","name":"The Power of Community Driving Diversity&Inclusion @ Togetherfest","rsvp_limit":40,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1542301200000,"local_date":"2018-11-15","local_time":"18:00","rsvp_close_offset":"PT1H","updated":1542384255000,"utc_offset":3600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":37,"venue":{"id":25992325,"name":"Arena","lat":52.496646881103516,"lon":13.453007698059082,"repinned":true,"address_1":"Eichenstrasse 4","city":"Berlin","country":"de","localized_country_name":"Germany"},"group":{"created":1490308689000,"name":"Women Techmakers Berlin","id":22986801,"join_mode":"open","lat":52.52000045776367,"lon":13.380000114440918,"urlname":"Women-Techmakers-Berlin","who":"Members","localized_location":"Berlin, Germany","state":"","country":"de","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Berlin"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/Women-Techmakers-Berlin/events/256210217/","manual_attendance_count":26,"description":"<p>Women Techmakers Berlin has grown quite a bit over the last few years and we are happy to invite you to join us for a celebration of entrepreneurship and social good.<br/>Meetup and WeWork are pairing up to host Togetherfest X Creator Awards in Berlin and we're organizing one of our favourite types of events in the beginning of the evening - a fireside chat to discuss about the power of community, bringing people together and enabling diversity and inclusion in tech.</p> <p>So, will you join our conversation and come meet us at Togetherfest x Creator Awards?<br/>Please RSVP on both Meetup and here (<a href=\"https://creatorberlin.splashthat.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://creatorberlin.splashthat.com/</a>) as we only have limited space available.</p> <p>★ What to expect? ★<br/>-&gt; Women Techmakers Berlin Meetup: 6:00 pm - 7:30 pm<br/>Irina Nistor (Senior Producer @ Zalando) and Corina Dumanovschi (Senior Product Manager &amp; Women Techmakers Berlin Organizer) will welcome you to our fireside chat.

It assumes that you know basic concepts of (object oriented) programming but we will start from the beginner level and build up. So, the more programming experience, the better — but total newbies are also welcome, provided that they invest the required amount of time for self-learning.</p> <p>The course is designed around open-source technologies, so a Unix-like system, Linux or MacOS is preferred. Git and Visual Studio Code will be our main tools, along with Node.js. Windows is not preferred, but if you absolutely have to live on Windows, you should have a working git and Node.js installation, and the rest will work.</p> <p><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Unofficial_JavaScript_logo_2.svg/1200px-Unofficial_JavaScript_logo_2.svg.png\" /></p> <p>FAQ<br/>- #js-crash-course on our slack<br/>- Some previous programming knowledge would be really useful<br/>- It's completely free<br/>- It's both for beginners and not-so beginners<br/>- Ideally you'll keep working on your project at home<br/>- We are meeting every WEDNESDAY until 5th of December<br/>- The meetups at the Eurostaff office<br/>- There will be drinks and snacks<br/>- All genders are welcome<br/>- RSVP opens one week in advance</p> <p>About our Head of Instructors<br/>Armagan is a software architect from Berlin and currently works as the Head of Software Engineering at unu GmbH.</p> <p>Following the software craftsmanship philosophy, he has taught over 40 young engineering graduates on software and helped them enter the software industry.</p> <p>For the last five years, he has been focusing on distributed cloud architectures and developed among many others an open-source framework, cote.js, for building microservices with Node.js.</p> <p>Follow Armagan on twitter.com/dashersw, <a href=\"https://github.com/dashersw\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/dashersw</a> or on his own blog <a href=\"https://arm.ag\" class=\"linkified\">https://arm.ag</a>.</p> <p>About Women Techmakers</p> <p><img src=\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/5/0/f/600_459373583.jpeg\" /><br/>Apart from programming courses, we organize workshops on topics like Public Speaking, React, Angular, Google Assistant and Fireside Chats with companies supporting diversity in Berlin’s tech ecosystem.</p> <p>Slack <a href=\"http://slack.wtmberlin.com\" class=\"linkified\">http://slack.wtmberlin.com</a> #js-crash-course<br/>Facebook Page: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/WomenTechmakersBerlinPage/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.facebook.com/WomenTechmakersBerlinPage/</a><br/>Facebook Group: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/1106085959408694/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.facebook.com/groups/1106085959408694/</a><br/>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WTM_berlin\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/WTM_berlin</a><br/>Meetup: www.meetup.com/women-Techmakers-Berlin/</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1539429605000,"duration":10800000,"id":"255503727","name":"Parents & Tech Brunch","rsvp_limit":60,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1543136400000,"local_date":"2018-11-25","local_time":"10:00","updated":1543149998000,"utc_offset":3600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":38,"venue":{"id":25390986,"name":" Mozilla Berlin","lat":52.49948501586914,"lon":13.449288368225098,"repinned":true,"address_1":"Schlesische Straße 27","city":"10997 Berlin","country":"de","localized_country_name":"Germany"},"group":{"created":1490308689000,"name":"Women Techmakers Berlin","id":22986801,"join_mode":"open","lat":52.52000045776367,"lon":13.380000114440918,"urlname":"Women-Techmakers-Berlin","who":"Members","localized_location":"Berlin, Germany","state":"","country":"de","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Berlin"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/Women-Techmakers-Berlin/events/255503727/","description":"<p>Technology is surrounding us.

You take your laptop and get started on your brilliant idea. But sooner or later you’ll need more advanced skills in certain areas. You hire a designer and a developer. But the product development does not take off as expected, because the collaboration between the two is rocky.<br/>So, why can’t we all just get along to create awesome products?</p> <p>7:10PM - 7:30PM<br/>#Getting it Wrong: Lessons in Empathy, Failure &amp; Stealing Agendas<br/>by Hailey Griffiths.<br/>Being the only UX person in an engineering team can be tough. Hailey's here to talk about making research collaborative, outsourcing UX tasks, and how building empathy can change a team.</p> <p>7:40 PM - 8:00PM<br/>#A designer, a developer and a half-baked product walk into a bar…<br/>by Kristin Baumann @kristin_baumann<br/>… trying to improve their collaboration issues &amp; deliver a product with joy.<br/>Kristin worked as a developer in a design team and will share her insights on the different perspectives and how the relationship between designers and developers can be improved step-by-step in your everyday work life.</p> <p>★ ABOUT THE SPEAKER ★<br/>Hailey fell into UX before she knew what it was, and was delighted to find that her inborn desire of “not wanting to annoy people” was a marketable skill. She believes deeply in the power of vulnerability and honesty.<br/>She strives to grow them in any team she joins.</p> <p>Kristin is a Senior Frontend Developer and has built tech products for the past couple of years. Her previous work as a developer in a design team has given her the opportunity to experience both sides of the designer-developer spectrum. As a result, she understands the true value and impact of a strong interdisciplinary collaboration. She currently works at the intersection of development, design and product management at Mein Grundeinkommen in Berlin.</p> <p>★ ABOUT THE HOSTING COMPANY ★<br/>OLX has been a host of one of our Fireside Chats - we are happy to collaborate again on this exciting event!</p> <p>We’re a global product and tech group.<br/>17 brands. 40 countries. 4000 people.

It assumes that you know basic concepts of (object oriented) programming but we will start from the beginner level and build up. So, the more programming experience, the better — but total newbies are also welcome, provided that they invest the required amount of time for self-learning.</p> <p>The course is designed around open-source technologies, so a Unix-like system, Linux or MacOS is preferred. Git and Visual Studio Code will be our main tools, along with Node.js. Windows is not preferred, but if you absolutely have to live on Windows, you should have a working git and Node.js installation, and the rest will work.</p> <p>FAQ<br/>- Some previous programming knowledge would be really useful<br/>- It's completely free<br/>- It's both for beginners and not-so beginners<br/>- Ideally you'll keep working on your project at home<br/>- All genders are welcome<br/>- RSVP opens one week in advance</p> <p>★ Lecture 8: Deploying &amp; Scaling Apps with Docker ★<br/>The final session in this series introduces the final step in an application’s lifecycle — the deployment. We learn the basics of Docker and how to deploy our Node.js applications with Docker. We introduce the concepts of continuous integration and continuous deployment, as well as automated testing. This session also includes scaling Node.js applications with load balancers and a reverse proxy setup with nginx.</p> <p>★ Before the class ★<br/>- Update your RSPV if you are not able to come.<br/>- Join our WTM Slack (<a href=\"https://slack.wtmberlin.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://slack.wtmberlin.com/</a>) and #js-crash-course group.<br/>- Check the pinned items of #js-crash-course.<br/>- Check our Welcome Guide (<a href=\"https://github.com/WTMBerlin/jscc-welcomeguide\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/WTMBerlin/jscc-welcomeguide</a>). Make sure that you have all the steps, and especially Docker, ready.<br/>- If possible, watch the previous videos to be on track (they are on the pinned items of #js-crash-course).<br/>- Don’t forget to bring your laptop and charger! :)</p> <p>★ About Our Instructor ★<br/>Armagan is a software architect from Berlin and currently works as the Senior Engineering Manager at Wayfair.</p> <p>Following the software craftsmanship philosophy, he has taught over 40 young engineering graduates on software and helped them enter the software industry.</p> <p>For the last five years, he has been focusing on distributed cloud architectures and developed among many others an open-source framework, cote.js, for building microservices with Node.js.</p> <p>Follow Armagan on twitter.com/dashersw, <a href=\"https://github.com/dashersw\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/dashersw</a> or on his own blog <a href=\"https://arm.ag\" class=\"linkified\">https://arm.ag</a>.</p> <p>★ ABOUT HOSTING COMPANY ★<br/>Wayfair is one of the world's largest online destinations for the home.
