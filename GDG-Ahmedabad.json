As a good developer you should always think about making reusable libraries and classes in your project. Libraries are supported in languages like PHP, Java or .Net. But what about frontend languages like JavaScript or TypeScript? Well, this is possible now with Angular. Since Angular 6, Angular CLI comes with ng-packager to generate and build Angular Libraries. This event is all about building Angular Libraries.</p> <p>We will start with how to create Angular Library project using Angular CLI and at end the event you will have deployable Angular Library that can be reused in any of the project.</p> <p>Before starting the event we would like to know your ideas about making Angular library and we would like you to build and publish Angular Libraries and share details with us.</p> <p>Schematics</p> <p>Angular schematics are great work flow tool for the modern web. Angular CLI uses schematics to apply transforms to web app projects. Schematics are easy to modify and define new ones to do things like update your code to fix breaking changes in a dependency or to add a new configuration option or framework to an existing project.</p> <p>We will see how you can define your custom schematics or override existing schematics in your app.</p> <p>These are hands on session, where you can bring your laptop with network connection and you can build library and schematics along with us.</p> <p>Speakers :</p> <p>Jinal Shah<br/>Hiren Dave</p> <p>Jinal Shah is the co-founder of Brainoorja Creations (www.brainoorja.com) and a corporate trainer imparting knowledge on various cutting-edge technologies, such as – Node JS, Angular and ionic.

RxJS allows you to solve hard problems with less code, promotes maintainability, readability, flexibility. These are few reasons on why RxJS is the better way to handle async operations right now. RxJS allows you to increase the power of your application with reactive programming techniques. In just a few lines of maintainable code, you can have multiplex web sockets and easily coordinate multiple Ajax requests. RxJS is also great for state management with asynchronous data flows. With RxJs, you can handle this in a declarative and flexible way alongside redux or you can replace Redux altogether.</p> <p>This event is all about Reactive Programming in Angular with RxJs. We will learn following core concept of RxJs</p> <p>Observables<br/>Observers<br/>Subscriptions</p> <p>Also we will see how we can handle HTTP requests with RxJs and how we can manage states with RxJs in your Angular application.</p> <p>This is hands on session for the experienced developers.
