But, why are programmers so excited about GitHub? We already had a session on Git and Github in May, but as it is so important for you to be able to work with this tool we will have a second session on this topic. Do not worry if you could not attend the first session.</p> <p>Git is an open source version control software. It allows more than one person to safely work on the same project without interfering with each other.</p> <p>It is a version control software allows you to have “versions” of a project, which show the changes that were made to the code over time, and allows you to backtrack if necessary and undo those changes. This ability alone – of being able to compare two versions or reverse changes, makes it fairly invaluable when working on larger projects.</p> <p>Although you can run your own Git server locally,</p> <p>Github</p> <p>is both a remote server, a community of developers, and a graphical web interface for managing your Git project. It’s free to use for up to 5 public repositories – that is, when anyone can view or fork your code – with low cost plans for private projects.</p> <p><b>Please bring:</b></p> <p>- your laptop</p> <p>- create an account with github </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2F&amp;h=kAQHO5kXnAQFduwZeJxJVsb2qxYgwJK6yX2CHWu-EhZiOZw&amp;enc=AZOG5IueTEKOxnKHdnu6mqBHeBVwkehMIEcApMkDqnibxkGgWHOVgNRauU2JxrWGayH_vpZ9afoDZMavgxs3-rmo4pT2K8dzQuomjRIMyaKvSA1JjPyS6tpyNvJt1mM9cUHLQJRhcw0kwJbf9PYWnISKY01faOo5o6yIHc0uP24ovg&amp;s=1\"><a href=\"https://github.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/</a></a></p> <p>- download the desktop version of git </p> <p><a href=\"https://desktop.github.com/\"><a href=\"https://desktop.github.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://desktop.github.com/</a></a></p> <p>- print out and bring with you the cheat sheet:</p> <p><a href=\"https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf\"><a href=\"https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf</a></a></p> <p>- your headphones, as we will be working with code academy/udacity</p> <p>About the program:</p> <p>Women Techmakers is Google’s brand and global program for women in technology.

We will dive deeper into Serenity, a tool that is commonly used for Testing.</p> <p><b>Behaviour Driven Development</b> or BDD, is a development approach where team members explore, and build a shared understanding of application requirements through conversations around examples.</p> <p>In Agile teams practicing BDD is often done before or early on in a sprint, in a special meeting sometimes called \"the three amigos\" or \"the three-way handshake\", where (at least) a BA (Business Analyst, Product Owner/Manager), a developer and a tester get together to work through examples from the acceptance criteria. The examples are then discussed by concrete illustrations of how the system should work, or how a user might use a feature. They help provoke discussion, uncovering assumptions and omissions that would have otherwise lead the development team into error further down the track.</p> <p><b>Serenity BDD</b> is an open source library that aims to make the idea of living documentation a reality. Serenity BDD helps you write cleaner and more maintainable automated acceptance and regression tests faster. Serenity also uses the test results to produce illustrated, narrative reports that document and describe what your application does and how it works. Serenity tells you not only what tests have been executed, but more importantly, what requirements have been tested.</p> <p>To get the most out of Serenity BDD, it is useful to understand some of the basic Serenity BDD behind Behaviour Driven Development and Automated Acceptance Testing.</p> <p>Serenity BDD is commonly used for both Automated Acceptance Tests and Regression Tests, and the principles discussed here apply, with minor variations, to both.</p> <p>Agenda:</p> <p>We will start with a presentation about Serenity and BDD and then do a Demo</p> <p><b>Our Speaker:</b></p> <p><img src=\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/d/0/5/event_461920197.jpeg\" /></p> <p><b><br/></b></p> <p><b>Alina Rotariu</b></p> <p>Alina about herself: \"I am a Quality Specialist at Otto, where i am focusing on setting up a good quality mindset, first of all, inside the team and then inside the project, being present in each step of the product's lifecycle.

Ob Customer Relationship Management, Online-Shop oder Backend-API für mobile Apps: Rails schafft die Verknüpfung von der Datenbank-Tabelle zur gewünschten Darstellung und Bearbeitung im Browser oder über andere Schnittstellen. Das Open-Source- und Community-basierte Baukastensystem der so genannten Gems und das ActiveRecord-Datenmuster von Rails setzen auf Rubys umfangreiche Libraries und gut lesbare Syntax auf. Unterstützt durch Konventionen für die Namensgebung von Dateien lassen sich Anforderungen schnell umsetzen und auch die Einarbeitung in bestehende Projekte ist mit ein wenig Erfahrung relativ leicht möglich.</p> <p>Was machen wir in diesem Workshop?</p> <p>Diese Veranstaltung möchte den Teilnehmerinnen einen groben Überblick über den Kosmos von Ruby on Rails geben, illustriert durch Beispiele aus der Praxis der AKRA GmbH, die bereits eine Vielzahl von Projekten mit dieser schönen Sprache umgesetzt und betreut hat.</p> <p>Wie könnt ihr danach weitermachen?</p> <p>Der Workshop wird mit einem Hands-on-Ruby-Kurs von MOINWORLD e.V. in den Folgewochen fortgesetzt.
