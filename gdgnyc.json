We’ll explore the difference between software agents (bots), intelligent agents, and learning agents. As the most complex class of agent, a learning agent has a sophisticated internal architecture, which we’ll break down into different capabilities. Finally, we’ll examine how the techniques from reactive machine learning can allow us to build learning capabilities into our agents.</p> <p>This talk will not just be about AI concepts, though. It will cover a range of pragmatic techniques to aid you in your efforts to implement learning agents. Throughout, we’ll consider where and how we can use external resources like libraries, services, datasets, and even humans to solve sub-problems in the agent design process.</p> <p><i><a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/gdgnyc/members/12497601\">Jeff Smith</a> builds large-scale artificial intelligence systems.

It quickly classifies images into thousands of categories (e.g., \"sailboat\", \"lion\", \"Eiffel Tower\"), detects individual objects and faces within images, and finds and reads printed words contained within images.</p> <p><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/\">Google Cloud Natural Language API</a> lets developers perform entity and sentiment analysis on text. The entity analysis feature lets you extract entities from text — like people, places and events — with a single API call. With sentiment analysis, you can determine whether a block of text is positive or negative, along with the overall strength of the sentence.</p> <p><i><a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/gdgnyc/members/52641582\">Sara Robinson </a>and <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/gdgnyc/members/54877462\">Bret McGowen</a> are Developer Advocates on the Google Cloud Team, both based out of NYC.</i></p> <p><b>8:20 pm ======== DEMO =================</b></p> <p><b>Neural Style in Tensor Flow</b></p> <p><b>ABSTRACT</b>: Neural Style is one of my favorite art experiments that uses machine learning.

The fields of Data Science and Machine Learning have seen tremendous growth in response to these new freedoms. While many have been working in the field and are already technical or conceptual experts, the topic can impose a steep barrier to entry for newcomers or folks without a technical background. </p> <p>We’ll go over the field at a high enough vantage and with sufficient depth that you could explain it and set realistic expectations for an interested stakeholder. </p> <p> <b>Speaker</b>: Aesa Kamar is a software development consultant by profession, and a lifelong learner who graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. He  has been involved in the Open Source community for a few years and loves the philosophy of science and its encouragement of tinkering and experimentation in pursuit of elusive answers. He tries to surround himself with interesting people who use technology to give more meaning and substance to their lives.</p> <p>6:30 pm <b>FEATURED TALK</b></p> <p><b>HOW BITCOIN ENABLES A MACHINE-PAYABLE WEB  </b><b>(Speaker: Balaji Srinivasan, CEO &amp; Co-Founder of 21.co)</b></p> <p><b>Abstract:  </b>First, we had the World Wide Web, a web of links between documents. Then we had the Social Web, a social network of relationships between people. We believe the third web will be the Machine-Payable Web, where each node in the network is a machine and each edge is a micropayment between machines.</p> <p>Towards this end, we've developed open source software called 21 that makes it easy to perform Bitcoin micropayments over HTTP. The software allows you to get digital currency onto any machine headlessly, set up web services that accept and transmit bitcoin over HTTP, and discover other machines with similar services to autonomously trade with.</p> <p>The overall effect is to turn digital currency into a scarce system resource on par with CPU, RAM, and hard drive space. That is, just as one can create a database index that spends disk space to save time, we show that one can instead spends digital currency to outsource a computation to save time.</p> <p>To illustrate the applications, we conclude with several working examples: bitcoin-aware intelligent agents, APIs that implement autonomous surge pricing, and the development of a market data structure as an alternative in many situations to the well known queue. We ask that audience members bring their laptops to code along with the speaker!</p> <p><b>Speaker: </b><i>Balaji S. Srinivasan is the CEO &amp; cofounder of <a href=\"http://21.co/\">21.co</a>and a Board Partner at Andreessen Horowitz. Prior to taking the role of CEO at 21, Dr. Srinivasan was a General Partner at Andreessen Horowitz. He was named to the MIT TR35, was the cofounder and CTO of Founders Fund-backed Counsyl, and taught a MOOC with 200k+ students at  <a href=\"http://startup.stanford.edu/\">startup.stanford.edu</a>.

You're familiar with many of the core keywords and have written lots of small snippets of code, some tools, and perhaps even a more sizable app or two. Perhaps you've even written some object-oriented code, used decorators, generators, or other intermediate features. But are you missing anything? Do you look at Python code written by others, understand most of it, but perhaps gloss over some subtleties? That's the issue with no longer being purely a beginner. You know stuff, but on occasion, it's not enough. What are some of those things that are hidden from you but still in plain sight?</p> <p>In this talk, you'll learn what some of these nuances are, perhaps helping you take a step or two closer towards better understanding and on a path towards mastery. This is an interactive best practices talk, focusing on Python feature, syntax, under-the-cover factoids, and idioms which relatively new users may not be aware of. All you need to bring is some basic knowledge of Python and a desire to learn more, and taking your Python skills to the next level. Time-permitting, I'll even show you some interesting Python-related tools from Google that may be useful for your applications.</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1464119957000,"duration":10800000,"id":"231372162","name":"[DevFest NYC Pre-Event] Google Apps Workshop & Firebase","rsvp_limit":200,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1479506400000,"local_date":"2016-11-18","local_time":"17:00","updated":1506430396000,"utc_offset":-18000000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":200,"is_online_event":false,"group":{"created":1459442969000,"name":"Google Developer Group (GDG) NYC","id":19782026,"join_mode":"open","lat":40.75,"lon":-73.98999786376953,"urlname":"gdgnyc","who":"Technologists","localized_location":"New York, NY","state":"NY","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Eastern"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdgnyc/events/231372162/","manual_attendance_count":200,"description":"<p><b>Venue: CHEL-2A-Atlantic City (Chelsea Market)</b></p> <p>Please note the change in venue!! We will be back at the 2nd floor venue in Chelsea Market.  When you enter Chelsea Market, take the black staircase (immediately to your right, just past the elevator) to the 2nd floor.</p> <p><b><br/></b></p> <p><b>ABOUT THIS PRE-DEVFEST MEETUP</b></p> <p><i>This meetup is free for all members of GDG NYC but an RSVP on this site is required for attendance.</i></p> <p><i>5:45pm</i>  <b>DOORS OPEN</b></p> <p><i><br/></i></p> <p><i>6:00pm <b>ANNOUNCEMENTS &amp; LIGHTNING TALKS</b></i></p> <p><i>Interested in giving a lightning talk?

We’ll use the problem of nudity detection to illustrate how training modern convolutional neural networks (convnets) differs from research done in the past. In particular, we'll discuss the notion of a deconvolutional network and demonstrate how they can be used to visualize intermediate feature layers and the operator of a classifier.</p> <p>Speaker Bio: Ryan Compton heads data science at Clarifai.

If you have questions or concerns, come talk to an organizer.</p> <p>== 7:15 pm ==</p> <p>FEATURED TALK : \"Building a new control plane for the Internet\"</p> <p>Abstract: Blockchain-based naming and PKI services can be used as a general-purpose “trust layer” for Internet applications. We present the design of a new blockchain-based naming and storage system called Blockstack, which can be used as a new control plane for the Internet. All lookups, key distribution, and data mappings are verified by this control plane, while traditional Internet infrastructure is used for the data plane. In this new model, we can get the performance of cloud computing along with security benefits of a fully decentralized system.</p> <p>Speaker Bio: Muneeb Ali is a co-founder of Blockstack Inc, a Y Combinator and Union Square Ventures backed startup focusing on blockchain technologies. Muneeb received his Masters in Computer Science from Princeton University and did PhD-level research in distributed systems at Princeton working in the systems group and at PlanetLab—the world’s first and largest cloud computing testbed. Muneeb was awarded a J. William Fulbright Fellowship and a Princeton Graduate Fellowship. He has built a wide range of production systems and published research papers with over 800 citations.</p> <p>Company description: Blockstack is a new decentralized Internet and platform for developers to build server-less apps secured by the blockchain.</p> <p>== 8:00 pm ==</p> <p>FIRESIDE CHAT: \"AI &amp; Education\", Dhruv Parthasarathy, Director of Learning @Udacity</p> <p>Abstract: Machine Learning and AI are becoming increasingly powerful technologies that will impact most industries. But there isn't currently a clear learning path for those seeking to pursue careers in this domain. Dhruv will talk about Udacity's Nanodegree program and how they are looking to fill this gap with the help of community and industry participation. He'll share some insights from their new Self-Driving Car Nanodegree program, and discuss the broader mission at Udacity -- a Tesla-like focus on starting with support for cutting-edge products (Self-Driving Car) while also providing a path for mass appeal solutions (e.g., Web Dev).</p> <p>The talk will be followed by a Q&amp;A session.

Great! Now you need a mobile app to engage your users even further. Or, better yet, you need to offer different, yet complimentary functionality, while retaining shared code between your web site and mobile app. Welcome to the beautiful world of Vue and NativeScript, which, paired together on the web and on mobile, make for a great user experience. In this talk, you’ll learn about my experience building Elocute, a web app for language teachers with a paired mobile app that students use to perfect their spoken language skills. You’ll discover how to build for the web and mobile platforms using NativeScript and Vue, making the most of the best of both platforms - data entry on the web, and speech-to-text on mobile. Let’s learn about how Vue can be used to build for the web and for mobile apps, sharing the love.</p> <p>SPEAKER:<br/>Jen Looper is a Google Developer Expert and a Senior Developer Advocate at Progress with over 15 years' experience as a web and mobile developer, specializing in creating cross-platform mobile apps.

And let’s face it, that can be daunting! Even just 10 years ago you needed access to extensive academic and computing resources to make use of machine learning. Today we’re seeing revolutionary changes in hardware and software that are democratizing machine learning and making it accessible to any developer or data scientist. Whether you’re new to ML or you’re already an expert, GCP has a variety of tools to help you. I’ll start with the basics: how to use a pre-trained ML model with a single API call. Then you’ll learn how to customize a pre-trained model with AutoML. I’ll end by showing how to train and serve a custom TensorFlow model on GCP.</p> <p>SPEAKER:<br/>Sara Robinson is a Developer Advocate on Google's Cloud Platform team, where she helps with developer relations through online content, outreach and events. She has a bachelor’s degree in Business and International Studies from Brandeis University.

In particular, blockchain allows untrusting parties to perform validated transactions between each other. The burden of validation is distributed among the distributed and decentralized network that underlies blockchain technology. As a result, control is more representative of network participants, eliminating the need for a centralized authority or company. Despite its promise as a technology disruptor, the transaction time and fees limit its practical use and application. New innovations in blockchain technology addressing these limitations will be discussed.</p> <p>Part 2 (Speaker: Pan Wangperawong (Co-Founder of Cristodaro.com), see biography at <a href=\"https://pan.wangperawong.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://pan.wangperawong.com/</a>)</p> <p>We delve into the world of smart contracts and specifically discuss the Ethereum blockchain. A smart contract is the evolution of cryptocurrency to encompass logical execution of code based on conditions and events of the universe as perceived by the blockchain network. As a cryptocurrency can be expressed as a smart contract, the Ethereum network can be a platform for minting new algorithmically controlled currencies without deploying a entirely new blockchain. Smart contracts on the Ethereum network are programmed natively in Solidity. We address practical issues with smart contracts and how the blockchain ecosystem is continually evolving to meet the needs of the community.</p> <p>8:00pm<br/>Government and Technology (Speaker: Ralph Yozzo, Running Computer Programmer)</p> <p>A discussion of how we in the tech community can help government better serve the public with transparency and cost effectiveness. For example, New York City is a growing city and our city needs good technology to scale otherwise the costs will skyrocket. This discussion will show what is currently the state of big cities such as New York City's budget via open data and hopefully will foster a discussion of how we in the tech community can help build a better future.</p> <p>8:15pm<br/>Lightning Talks &amp; Discussion</p> <p>Please email [masked] if you have ideas for Lightning talks.</p> <p>8:30pm<br/>Doors Close</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1507753704000,"duration":16200000,"id":"244123474","name":"[SPECIAL EVENT] I/O Extended 2018 New York City + Machine Learning Study Jam","rsvp_limit":300,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1528142400000,"local_date":"2018-06-04","local_time":"16:00","updated":1528287807000,"utc_offset":-14400000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":300,"venue":{"id":24981387,"name":"Google Chelsea Market, 2nd floor","lat":40.7425537109375,"lon":-74.0060806274414,"repinned":false,"address_1":"75 9th Avenue","city":"New York","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"","state":"NY"},"is_online_event":false,"group":{"created":1459442969000,"name":"Google Developer Group (GDG) NYC","id":19782026,"join_mode":"open","lat":40.75,"lon":-73.98999786376953,"urlname":"gdgnyc","who":"Technologists","localized_location":"New York, NY","state":"NY","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Eastern"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdgnyc/events/244123474/","manual_attendance_count":120,"description":"<p>ABOUT GOOGLE IO EXTENDED NEW YORK CITY<br/>We revisit our annual tradition of hosting a recap event on Google I/O featuring talks, codelabs, in-person experiences and discussion related to the latest announcements from I/O.</p> <p>AGENDA:<br/>==========</p> <p>4:00 pm<br/>STUDY GROUP &amp; CODELABS SESSION<br/>-- (20 mins) \"Flutter: An Introduction\" - Nitya Narasimhan<br/>-- (90 mins) Choose Your Adventure - Self-Guided<br/>-------- a.

DOORS CLOSE</p> <p>TALK ABSTRACTS<br/>===================<br/>FEATURE TALK: Sparking More Meetups with ML<br/>Speaker: Shayak Banerjee, Machine Learning Team @Meetup</p> <p>Meetup is a platform for people to connect in-real-life around shared interests. Meetup organizers and members are both central to that experience. Part of our challenge is to match a newly formed group with its relevant audience so as to build its initial critical mass. Meetup has been using Machine Learning to enable this connection for years now, via the new group announcement (NGA) email. In this talk, we’ll look at how the infrastructure for performing this task has been revamped over the past year. From a logistic regression model which computed all features in-memory and consumed 150GB+ of heap, we journeyed into the world of batch / distributed processing. We’ll describe how we migrated to use Apache Spark running on Dataproc clusters to enable calculating a much richer set of features, which is then used by gradient-boosted trees to score member-group pairs. We'll show how this gave us a 30% increase in members joining groups! We’ll also talk about how our batch jobs are orchestrated using Airflow and monitored using Datadog and Cloudwatch. We’ll end with a look at the problems we incurred with “bedding-in” this system, such as latency and optimizing workloads.</p> <p>With 3 million members and growing, and more than 500 new groups being formed every day across the world, we see this as the infrastructure that will allow us to scale to “Spark\"ing more Meetups, more connections and more change.</p> <p>====<br/>IO18 TALK / WEB: Alternative Architectures for your PWA<br/>Speaker: Jeff Posnick (Chrome Developer Relations Team @Google)</p> <p>Building a Progressive Web App (PWA) doesn't mean building a single page app!

Surprisingly, not much! In this talk, we will create a Dialogflow app to get Google Assistant to talk to a container managed by Kubernetes/App Engine. In the container, we’ll use some of the Machine Learning APIs and BigQuery and see how they can elevate our Google Assistant app to the next level. We will also integrate with Stackdriver and see how you can get more insights about your app with HTTP tracing and live debugging features of Stackdriver.</p> <p>Learn More: <a href=\"https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2018/07/google-home-meets-net-containers-using-dialogflow.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2018/07/google-home-meets-net-containers-using-dialogflow.html</a></p> <p>=====<br/>7:15 pm<br/>MANGA TRANSLATION WITH CLOUD VISION &amp; .NET (Speaker: Jon Foust, Google Cloud Developer Advocate, NYC)</p> <p>====<br/>7:45pm<br/>FOCUS ON YOUR CODE, NOT YOUR INFRASTRUCTURE (Speaker: Martin Omander, Google Cloud Developer Advocate, MV)</p> <p>When you build a backend to a web app or mobile app, you want to focus on your business logic, not on your infrastructure. At the same time, you want the infrastructure to always be there for you, ready to run your code. Google Cloud Functions does that for you.</p> <p>In this talk, we will follow the story of the fictional startup \"In Jest\", publishers of an app that tells jokes. At first, the developers at \"In Jest\" need to get a minimum viable product up and running in an hour. As their business grows they will have to integrate with Google Sheets, SQL databases, analytics systems, marketing systems and so on. We will see the code used to make this happen, without having to worry the team about servers and data centers.</p> <p>===<br/>8:30pm Doors Close</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1540507209000,"duration":120600000,"id":"255842341","name":"[Partner Event] Android Dev Summit Viewing Party","rsvp_limit":1,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1541608200000,"local_date":"2018-11-07","local_time":"11:30","updated":1541732721000,"utc_offset":-18000000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":1,"venue":{"id":24442422,"name":"AMC Loews 34 Street 14","lat":40.7524528503418,"lon":-73.99486541748047,"repinned":true,"address_1":"312 W. 34 Street","city":"New York","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"","state":"NY"},"is_online_event":false,"group":{"created":1459442969000,"name":"Google Developer Group (GDG) NYC","id":19782026,"join_mode":"open","lat":40.75,"lon":-73.98999786376953,"urlname":"gdgnyc","who":"Technologists","localized_location":"New York, NY","state":"NY","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Eastern"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdgnyc/events/255842341/","description":"<p>We invite you to the special &amp; unique viewing parties ever!<br/>Android Dev Summit is happening on November 7-8, 2018 in Computer History Museum.
