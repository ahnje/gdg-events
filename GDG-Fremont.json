The web has become so much more powerful in what we can do, though. JavaScript frameworks allow developers to build a powerful web app with a fraction of the time and resources of native apps. While tools like Ionic are allowing developers to make beautiful web apps that look and behave so much like native application with their UI and offline capabilities; so much so that users might not even tell the difference. Even cooler is now you can install apps from the web onto your phone like a native app.</p> <p>The web is advancing at an unprecedented rate, and you should be taking advantage of this. Learn what makes a progressive web app so progressive and some of the tooling you can use to build amazing (web) apps!</p> <p>Vikram Tiwari: Cloud Run and AutoML Tables @Vikram_Tiwari</p> <p>Serverless compute and ML on Google Cloud using Cloud Run and AutoML.</p> <p>Building scalable web and data platforms for high availability, resilience, and security.

And now in 2020, despite the challenges faced by everybody, we are still hard at work to enhance your app development experience. In this talk we will look at several new features Firebase introduced in the recent past.</p> <p>We will start with the Firebase Emulator suite, which enables developers to locally test their Firestore and Security Rules integrations. We will see how to write unit tests around your app's database interactions, so that you can systematically reason about the correctness and security of your code. We will also look at some new additions to the Firestore Security Rules language, and how they can be used to specify complex access and integrity constraints for your data.</p> <p>Next we will look at Firebase Remote Config support for the web, and how you can build custom web experiences based on your user's browser, location and various other preferences. We will also get acquainted with Firebase Extensions, a series of pre-packaged solutions that you can add to your apps to extend their capabilities.</p> <p>Speaker • Hiranya Jayathilaka</p> <p>### FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</p> <p>Here’s what you should know.
