Mobile web development can be a gnarly beast from a code perspective, but how much time do you give to the experience the folks using your application will have? Boilerstrapping Usability for Android will give you some quick routes when \"we've run out of time/budget\" comes up in conversations about usability. Maybe you don't have a dedicated resource on your team\u2026 we'll go over some self-starter activities you can do yourself on a bar napkin\u2026 that is, if you choose that route. Maybe we'll spend the entire time looking at design conventions\u2026 or just complaining about why it took them so long to move to a consistent (ish) experience across devices. This presentation will be interactive in the style of the choose-your-own-adventure books of old, so show up ready to help steer because by the end, Chris prefers that the blame (err\u2026 success) is shared all around.</p> <p> </p> <p><b>About Chris</b></p> <p>Who is this Chris guy? He's an experience designer and interface developer for ThoughtWorks, a community of passionate individuals looking to do the best software design and delivery while advocating for positive social change along the way. He's a proponent of mobile-first thinking (when appropriate) and tries to close the loop between feedback, design, and development as close as the laws of physics will allow. He's been venturing around for the past few years working with startups and companies on MVP development, pivots, and other such things with an emphasis on Science and user input.
