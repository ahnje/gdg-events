This way, they can build something in an area that they care about or are interested in. The conference will consist of cool and vibrant events and will concentrate on \"Everyday Google\" and will contain talks and discussions by developers on Google technologies used in everyday life like Google Assistant, Firebase, etc. It will also be discussed by core developers already working or interested in working with the Developers team. The focus of the conference is materializing an integrated community of developers making it easy for everyone to reach out and help each other in their future endeavors.</p> ","how_to_find_us":"33-401, Lovely Professional University","visibility":"public"},{"created":1547488580000,"duration":115200000,"id":"258071502","name":"Build with Angular","rsvp_limit":5,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1550892600000,"local_date":"2019-02-23","local_time":"09:00","updated":1551074579000,"utc_offset":19800000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":5,"venue":{"id":25212386,"name":"Lovely Professional University","lat":31.255550384521484,"lon":75.70552062988281,"repinned":false,"address_1":"Jalandhar-Delhi G.T.
