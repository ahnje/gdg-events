There are many ways that you can allow your users to identify themselves, such as implementing a sign in functionality of your own, where you manage your users and their credentials, or, as is becoming increasingly more common, you can allow them to sign in using their credentials from commonly used platforms such as Facebook, Twitter or Google.</p> <p>In this lab, you’ll learn how to provide sign-in functionality to your Android App, built using Android Studio, using Google Sign-In.</p> <p>Google Sign-In is a technology that allows you to get users into your apps quickly and securely with little development work required. It allows you to create a seamless experience across screens for your users -- they sign in once, and are authenticated on all of your devices. It allows you to integrate Google’s services into your websites and mobile apps, and also enables over-the-air installation of Android apps when users sign into your web sites. In this lesson you’ll learn how to add Google Sign-In to your android app -- and how to manage the workflow of your users signing into your app.</p> ","how_to_find_us":"To the left of the Cheesecake Factory entrance, 2nd floor","visibility":"public"},{"created":1447681314000,"id":"226810436","name":"Protocol Buffers","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1447974000000,"local_date":"2015-11-19","local_time":"18:00","updated":1448025737000,"utc_offset":-18000000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":7,"venue":{"id":15569292,"name":"757 Creative Space","lat":36.84980010986328,"lon":-76.29055786132812,"repinned":false,"address_1":"259 Granby St","address_2":"Ste 250","city":"Norfolk","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","phone":"(757) 912-0006","zip":"23510","state":"VA"},"group":{"created":1400075511000,"name":"GDG Hampton Roads","id":14450672,"join_mode":"open","lat":36.849998474121094,"lon":-76.29000091552734,"urlname":"GDG-Hampton-Roads","who":"Google Tech Enthusiast","localized_location":"Norfolk, VA","state":"VA","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Eastern"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Hampton-Roads/events/226810436/","manual_attendance_count":7,"description":"<p>Protocol buffers are a language-neutral, platform-neutral extensible mechanism for serializing structured data.</p> <p>Come learn about them at this month's GDG Hampton Roads meeting!</p> ","how_to_find_us":"Go into the elevator next to the subway.
