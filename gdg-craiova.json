Let’s pragmatically review the key decisions of a typical enterprise application architecture and learn to balance simplicity with design goals.</p> <p>We know that without continuous refactoring, simplistic design always degenerates into a Big Ball of Mud, under the assault of new features and patchy bugfixes. At the other end however, over-engineered code can burden the start-up of the development and sometimes even lock the developers in some rigid ‘a-priori’ design. It’s our duty to regularly challenge the architecture of our system and seek ways to simplify it to fit our present needs. Join this talk and learn how to do just-in-time design to keep as many use-cases as simple as possible (KISS).</p> <p>“Architecture is the art of postponing decisions”, claims Uncle Bob. This session takes this idea further and explains how to Evolve a Pragmatic, Clean Architecture. It’s the philosophy Victor applied to design and develop numerous applications for IBM, and a key topic of the trainings he delivered at dozens of companies.</p> <p>Along the way, you’ll also get a review of the fundamental data structure types (Entity, VO, DTO), logic class (Services, Facades, Adapters and Repositories) along with several techniques to keep the logic simple via two types of extractions, enforcing boundaries using dependency directions, and crafting a testable design. All in a fun, dynamic and interactive session you will never forget.</p> <p>----- 2nd part: Live-Coding -----</p> <p>For the second part of the meetup, Victor will perform a live-coding session on a topic the audience selects during break (voting). Among the topics:<br/>- Test-Driven Development<br/>- Functional Programming with Java 8<br/>- Refactoring Exercise</p> <p>---- Who: Victor Rentea -----</p> <p>Victor Rentea is Java Champion and one of the top Independent Trainers in Romania, having trained by now 1500+ developers in 30+ companies. He is Lead Architect at IBM, where he practices Pair Programming, Clean Code and Refactoring every day. For the community, he organized the largest 3 Bucharest Java User Group meetups in history, and last year he founded the Bucharest Software Craftsmanship Community in which he runs free webinars about clean code, refactoring and TDD.</p> <p>As a speaker, Victor is now regularly invited at the top international conferences: his live-coding sessions are insane, lightning-fast but well crafted, full of enthusiasm, deep insights and take-away tips.
