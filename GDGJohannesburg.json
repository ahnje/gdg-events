To be clear, this is a 'framework' that is actively courting its own obsolescence, growing smaller with every subsequent release.</p> <p>It is in pursuit of this that the latest version of Polymer was announced, informed by recent W3C standardisation victories as well as mainstream adoption of Web Platform features. The project is removing features, changing the ecosystem, improving cross-framework interop, all to empower the platform.</p> <p>This talk will give a brief overview of Polymer 3.0, the direction of WebComponents and make a case for why you should care about Polymer and the direction of the Web Platform.</p> <p><b>Speaker: </b><a href=\"https://twitter.com/mikegeyser\">Mike Geyser</a></p> <p><b>Speaker Bio:</b></p> <p>Mike Geyser is a programmer at BBD in the R&amp;D team, specialising on designing and building for the web. He’s been hacking on the web since Geocities was a thing, has a long-lived love affair with JavaScript, and has (almost) come to terms with the fact that he will never have a programmer beard. While he has worked on some interesting large-scale enterprise applications, it is the challenges of the public web that really appeal to him - having earned his stripes on high volume transactional websites. He works primarily in JavaScript, C# and Java, and seldom refers to himself in the third person.</p> <p><b>Talk 2: Mastering Android ConstraintLayout (45min)</b></p> <p>In this talk, Rebecca will demonstrate how to use ConstraintLayout when building Android Apps and some cool tricks you can do with it. From simplifying complex layouts to creating animations, ConstraintLayout has some really great usages. </p> <p><b>Speaker: </b><a href=\"https://twitter.com/riggaroo\">Rebecca Franks</a></p> <p><b>Speaker Bio: </b></p> <p>Rebecca Franks the Android Engineering Lead at <a href=\"http://dvt.co.za/\">DVT</a>.

He is excited to see newcomers like Kotlin changing the way we think about and write code. He lives with his wife and four children in the Jacaranda city. </p> <p><b>Talk 2: A Web of Things (45min)</b></p> <p>Devices, smart devices everywhere. This is what our world is turning into. Your car tells you how to drive, your watch tells you when to exercise, and your phone tells you when you are hungry. OK, maybe that last bit is a little over the top, but I’m sure someone will make an app like that soon. All of this is controlled by applications which use Bluetooth and Wi-Fi to connect and communicate with each other. However, this is never enough for us as developers, we need to be in control.</p> <p>The Chrome dev team started the Physical Web movement with the intention of making everything smarter. With Web Bluetooth we can control almost any Bluetooth Low Energy device from a website. No longer dependent on the platform we are using or on apps which require installation or updates. All we need is a browser which supports it.</p> <p>This talk will cover some of the fundamental concepts of connecting to BLE devices using Chrome and broadcasting from BLE beacons, including the privacy and security considerations. It will go into some coding examples of how this can be done using the Angular bluetooth module. </p> <p><b>Speaker:</b> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GerybBg\">Gergana Young</a></p> <p><b>Speaker Bio:</b> Software developer, adventurer, and Star Wars geek extraordinaire.

These voice and text-based interfaces are making their way into our products and it turns out, are actually simple to build.</p> <p>We will give you a ridiculously short, principled understanding of natural language processing, using Google's DialogFlow and Cloud Functions, while building a chatbot that can handle registering a user for your site and responding to small talk. As a bonus let’s control our root.co.za account with our voice, for reals. Let’s explore this together as we share our foray into text-based interfaces &amp; how we can apply them right now.</p> <p>Speaker: Simon Van Dyk and Arrie Pieterse</p> <p>Simon is a technical product lead at Platform45, interested in everything software from design &amp; development to machine learning. On his journey, Simon loves sharing his learnings, and has given a couple talks in South Africa and the USA. Catch him on Github (@sighmin), or at simonvandyk.co.za.</p> <p>Arrie is a developer at Platform45 passionate about the intersection of design and innovative technologies ranging from chatbots and voice interfaces to machine learning and DAPPs.

How do we beat the rest and do it well and fast? This is when the terms 'Design Lead', 'User Experience' and 'Human Centered Design' start making an appearance. What makes this way of developing products so important? How do we as the Engineers, Designers and Product Owners deal with budgets, crazy deadlines, skepticism, delivering at scale and getting business to buy in? How do we create interfaces that make a user fall in love with our products and why are design guidelines like Google Material Design important in making a user feel at ease?</p> <p>This talk will be about unpacking the minefield that is product development and finding ways that we can make our mark, as a development and design team (we are in the same boat) so that we can have an impact and make magic.</p> <p>Speaker: Niki De Bruyn</p> <p>Niki is a Senior User Experience Designer at DVT.

She attended the 2017 Firebase Dev Summit through Google's Women Techmakers program which provides visibility, support and empowers women in the tech industry.</p> <p>Talk 3: Building an artificial John Lennon with Keras (45 min)<br/>We live in a world where amazing APIs have made it easy to play in complex fields such as AI. Francois Chollet's Keras is one of those libraries that makes working with complex neural networks a breeze. The talk aims to give an intuitive understanding of machine learning (specifically for working with natural language), introduce you to Keras, and then demonstrate how to train an AI to write songs like The Beatles.

Never fear; we will use the incredible Workbox library (and tools) to dispel all shadows of doubt, and confidently build service workers.</p> <p>This code-oriented talk takes an extensive look at the different ways workbox can be used. It shows different pre- and runtime-caching strategies, explains the challenges behind service worker life cycle events, and explores offline strategies using background sync. It will even show you how workbox can be used on traditional server-side websites - giving them a real performance boost.
