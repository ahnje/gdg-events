The project is removing features, changing the ecosystem, improving cross-framework interop, all to empower the platform.</p> <p>This talk will give a brief overview of Polymer 3.0, the direction of WebComponents and make a case for why you should care about Polymer and the direction of the Web Platform.</p> <p><b>Speaker: </b><a href=\"https://twitter.com/mikegeyser\">Mike Geyser</a></p> <p><b>Speaker Bio:</b></p> <p>Mike Geyser is a programmer at BBD in the R&amp;D team, specialising on designing and building for the web. He’s been hacking on the web since Geocities was a thing, has a long-lived love affair with JavaScript, and has (almost) come to terms with the fact that he will never have a programmer beard. While he has worked on some interesting large-scale enterprise applications, it is the challenges of the public web that really appeal to him - having earned his stripes on high volume transactional websites. He works primarily in JavaScript, C# and Java, and seldom refers to himself in the third person.</p> <p><b>Talk 2: Mastering Android ConstraintLayout (45min)</b></p> <p>In this talk, Rebecca will demonstrate how to use ConstraintLayout when building Android Apps and some cool tricks you can do with it.

Please join us in celebrating a great year of knowledge sharing and community growth :)</p> <p><b>Talk 1: Re-inventing Android development with Kotlin (40min) </b></p> <p>This is an introductory talk on Kotlin, covering language features and syntax.</p> <p><b>Speaker</b>: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/codemaster263\">Tashinga Pemhiwa</a></p> <p><b>Speaker Bio:</b> Tashinga Nathan Pemhiwa is a software developer who has dabbled in various languages from Delphi and VB 6 to Java to PHP and JavaScript. He is excited to see newcomers like Kotlin changing the way we think about and write code. He lives with his wife and four children in the Jacaranda city. </p> <p><b>Talk 2: A Web of Things (45min)</b></p> <p>Devices, smart devices everywhere. This is what our world is turning into. Your car tells you how to drive, your watch tells you when to exercise, and your phone tells you when you are hungry. OK, maybe that last bit is a little over the top, but I’m sure someone will make an app like that soon. All of this is controlled by applications which use Bluetooth and Wi-Fi to connect and communicate with each other. However, this is never enough for us as developers, we need to be in control.</p> <p>The Chrome dev team started the Physical Web movement with the intention of making everything smarter. With Web Bluetooth we can control almost any Bluetooth Low Energy device from a website. No longer dependent on the platform we are using or on apps which require installation or updates. All we need is a browser which supports it.</p> <p>This talk will cover some of the fundamental concepts of connecting to BLE devices using Chrome and broadcasting from BLE beacons, including the privacy and security considerations. It will go into some coding examples of how this can be done using the Angular bluetooth module. </p> <p><b>Speaker:</b> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GerybBg\">Gergana Young</a></p> <p><b>Speaker Bio:</b> Software developer, adventurer, and Star Wars geek extraordinaire.

These voice and text-based interfaces are making their way into our products and it turns out, are actually simple to build.</p> <p>We will give you a ridiculously short, principled understanding of natural language processing, using Google's DialogFlow and Cloud Functions, while building a chatbot that can handle registering a user for your site and responding to small talk. As a bonus let’s control our root.co.za account with our voice, for reals. Let’s explore this together as we share our foray into text-based interfaces &amp; how we can apply them right now.</p> <p>Speaker: Simon Van Dyk and Arrie Pieterse</p> <p>Simon is a technical product lead at Platform45, interested in everything software from design &amp; development to machine learning.

How do we beat the rest and do it well and fast? This is when the terms 'Design Lead', 'User Experience' and 'Human Centered Design' start making an appearance. What makes this way of developing products so important? How do we as the Engineers, Designers and Product Owners deal with budgets, crazy deadlines, skepticism, delivering at scale and getting business to buy in? How do we create interfaces that make a user fall in love with our products and why are design guidelines like Google Material Design important in making a user feel at ease?</p> <p>This talk will be about unpacking the minefield that is product development and finding ways that we can make our mark, as a development and design team (we are in the same boat) so that we can have an impact and make magic.</p> <p>Speaker: Niki De Bruyn</p> <p>Niki is a Senior User Experience Designer at DVT.

She attended the 2017 Firebase Dev Summit through Google's Women Techmakers program which provides visibility, support and empowers women in the tech industry.</p> <p>Talk 3: Building an artificial John Lennon with Keras (45 min)<br/>We live in a world where amazing APIs have made it easy to play in complex fields such as AI. Francois Chollet's Keras is one of those libraries that makes working with complex neural networks a breeze. The talk aims to give an intuitive understanding of machine learning (specifically for working with natural language), introduce you to Keras, and then demonstrate how to train an AI to write songs like The Beatles.

Never fear; we will use the incredible Workbox library (and tools) to dispel all shadows of doubt, and confidently build service workers.</p> <p>This code-oriented talk takes an extensive look at the different ways workbox can be used. It shows different pre- and runtime-caching strategies, explains the challenges behind service worker life cycle events, and explores offline strategies using background sync. It will even show you how workbox can be used on traditional server-side websites - giving them a real performance boost.

But these are not the droids we are looking for. What if I told you it is about USB on the web?<br/>For me, USB devices running on the web include adventures with ActiveX, Internet Explorer 8 and Windows XP. USB devices whose drivers only run under very specific and relatively old conditions, but are still a requirement. We have one of three options: We settle for what we have been presented with, we splash out and replace all of the devices, or we find a new, more creative, cross-platform solution.<br/>JavaScript: A new hope! In this talk, I would like to tell you about the WebUSB API, what it is, how it works, and what it means for web developers. Using some devices I have had to deal with, I will show you how to connect to them directly from the browser.

This has unfortunately led many developers to see machine learning as something out of their reach. I will show you how we can make use of the web browser to run prebuilt tensorflow.js models just as we would use any other JavaScript software library. We will look at the advantages of using the web browser for doing machine learning, and how we can take advantage of something called transfer learning to tweak existing models to do some really fun things in the browser. This talk is suitable for beginners and no existing machine learning knowledge is required.</p> <p>Bio<br/>Richard is a software developer with a passion for problem solving and anything web related. He considers himself somewhat of a polyglot programmer and has worked on systems that do everything from calculating optimal pizza toppings to teaching languages in the classroom using AI. Richard now works as a Research Engineer at IBM Research where he is helping to deliver innovative solutions to some of Africa's biggest challenges.</p> <p>18:40 - 18:45 - Small Breather</p> <p>18:45 - 19:30 - Light up the web with lit-html 🔥</p> <p>What if I told you that building on the web could be easier? What if I told you that you didn't need complicated frameworks, confusing tools and convoluted builds? Let me introduce you to my little friend; lit-html 🔥. At only 3.5kb gzipped (⁉️) this miniscule framework leverages off of the modern web platform to make it efficient, expressive, and extensible.</p> <p>In this code oriented talk, I hope to show how low friction it is to work with lit-html. Together we'll build a TodoMVC application, starting from first principles and ending with WebComponents - all with (almost) zero tooling. Come and see for yourself: the web can be easy, fun and lit 🔥 - Mike Geyser</p> <p>Bio</p> <p>Mike Geyser is a Google Developer Expert in Web Technologies from South Africa, where he works in the R&amp;D team at a company called BBD. He is a co-organiser of the Jozi.Js meetup groups, and is a frequent technical speaker. He has been hacking on the web since Geocities was a 'thing', and has the keening wail of dialup modem etched into his subconscious. While he is fluent in several ‘golden hammer’ programming languages, he has a long-lived love affair with JavaScript, and cannot see its (many, obvious) flaws. He has worked on lots of interesting enterprise applications, but it is the challenges of the public web that really appeal to him - having spent his formative years building transactional websites. He is always eager to talk about the web platform, but be warned, he is prone to hyperbole.</p> <p>19:30 - 19:45 - Giveaways and Thanks!</p> <p>LOCATION:<br/>JoziHub, 44 Stanley.</p> <p>WHAT TO EXPECT:<br/>Lots of great content and smart developers!

Well, my young apprentice, to do that you require two things. The first is to master the force. The second, a lightsaber. Lucky for you, you've come to the right session!</p> <p>In this gadget, code and Star Wars filled talk we are going to cover everything you need to know about building a smart lightsaber. We will talk about all of the parts required: lights, sounds, buttons, accelerometers and style. Components alone are not enough, we'll need some knowledge of the force (also known as JavaScript) to connect our lightsaber to the internet.</p> <p>Join me, and together we can rule the galaxy... No, wait, I got carried away there...</p> <p>Bio<br/>Gergana Young is a software developer, adventurer, and Star Wars geek extraordinaire. Intending on making a career of reprogramming astromech droids with JavaScript, she abandoned the Imperial Academy and defected to BBD. After a tour of duty in the banking sector, working on .NET, JavaScript, Angular and Meteor, she finally found her place in the R&amp;D team. In her spare time, she builds cool software and \"things\" for her other passions: rock climbing, running and, of course, Star Wars.</p> <p>18:55 - 19:00 - Small Breather</p> <p>19:00 - 19:40 - Q-lued up with Android 10: Understanding the privacy requirements of Android 10 - Ahmed Tikiwa</p> <p>Over the years Android has seen exponential growth and with that growth, a vast number of functionality has been added to the Android ecosystem. There has however been one thing lacking - allowing the user more control over their privacy. Apart from the usual UI updates and the new Dark Mode, Google has taken a deliberate stance with providing users with the control they have so desperately needed.</p> <p>In this session, I will be discussing the top privacy changes that are part of Android 10 and why these changes are important to both Android users and developers.</p> <p>Bio<br/>Ahmed Tikiwa is a seasoned full-stack developer with over 8 years of experience and possesses a strong passion for developing world-class applications that can help change the world. He has experience in both frontend and backend systems, where he has built enterprise solutions for major telecommunication companies. He holds an Android Nanodegree from Google and Udacity and is currently an Android Engineer at Luno.</p> <p>19:40 - 19:55 - Giveaways and Thanks!</p> <p>WHAT TO EXPECT:<br/>Lots of great content and smart developers!

As my journey continued, I began to realise that the success of the products that I worked on, as well as my professional fulfilment, were influenced by the dynamics of the teams I work with.

From the science behind why diversity boosts performance, to why being the only woman in your project team is more of a problem than you might think, this talk takes a closer look at the realities of inequality in our industry, how each one of us has a role to play in the solution and what we should be doing to move our industry forward.</p> <p>If you’ve ever wondered about how we improve diversity in software engineering, or if you’ve never wondered, then this is the right room for you.</p> <p>Bio<br/>Two decades of creating software in financial services and the thrill of seeing solutions come to life is still there.
