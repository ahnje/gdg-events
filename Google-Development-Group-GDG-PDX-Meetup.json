One of the main challenges for AR/VR these days is content delivery which requires giant downloads and complicated app store installation steps, and often involves proprietary stacks which lock users to a particular vendor. Leading VR/AR companies have spent significant resources to create content yet it didn’t proliferate because it was cumbersome for developers to go to market: multiple vendors, multiple SDKs and the need for extensive skillsets. </p> <p>WebVR is a way to address this challenge. It leverages the power of the web platform -- low friction, discoverability, indexing and an open and easy development environment -- to help deliver rich and entertaining portable experiences. The web doesn’t pose gatekeepers -- you can deploy or instantly update a virtual or augmented reality experience on your website. </p> <p>WebVR allows developers to easily create virtual experiences that can be seamlessly deployed across different operating systems and browsers without compromising capabilities. In this presentation, we’ll introduce WebVR, its scope and the current status of standardizing the API, and then show how you can create a VR or AR experience quickly using the web platform.</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1507583751000,"id":"244065622","name":"WebVR, VR for the Web Take 2","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1511920800000,"local_date":"2017-11-28","local_time":"18:00","updated":1512365513000,"utc_offset":-28800000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":38,"venue":{"id":23874706,"name":"eBay Community Lounge","lat":45.51366424560547,"lon":-122.67977905273438,"repinned":false,"address_1":"1400 SW 5th Ave., 3rd Floor","city":"Portland","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"","state":"OR"},"group":{"created":1453501011000,"name":"Google Development Group (GDG) PDX Meetup","id":19415051,"join_mode":"open","lat":45.5,"lon":-122.69000244140625,"urlname":"Google-Development-Group-GDG-PDX-Meetup","who":"GDG'ers","localized_location":"Portland, OR","state":"OR","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Pacific"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/Google-Development-Group-GDG-PDX-Meetup/events/244065622/","description":"<p>Alexis Ménard will be following up on his excellent introduction to WebVR:</p> <p>WebVR allows developers to easily create virtual experiences that can be seamlessly deployed across different operating systems and browsers without compromising capabilities.
