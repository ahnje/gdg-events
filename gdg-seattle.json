This is the World were eCommerce actually means mCommerce where consumers want to make remote and proximity mobile payments on Smartphones and Tablet PCs.</p> <p>Merchants, and retail chains want to tap into consumers with convenient payment options at check-out lines with point-of-sale terminals. Wireless operators, Bankers want to migrate from using a plastic credit cards to a mobile wallet to perform the payment transaction. Local city and state transportations authorities want to enable more usage of public transportation by offering Contactless NFC Transit card or mobile payment applications for mobile wallet usage with top-up transit card payment options, and of course, major Smartphone and Tablet PC manufacturers are willing to build in the technology needed with security to facilitate these lifestyle payment and multiple use applications on mobile devices. It all sounds great on paper; however, in reality much of the technology used in Contactless mobile (NFC) payments comes from overseas and the ecosystem has become fragmented and in Puget Sound we need to better integrate all these use cases with key stakeholders to offer a complete turn-key, one stop solution in a mobile wallet on a Smartphone. And, of course there is user awareness that needs to improve and ISIS is launched but what does that means to the average consumer so far?

Kubernetes enables users to ask a cluster to run a set of containers. The system will automatically pick worker nodes to run those containers on, which we think of more as \"scheduling\" than \"orchestration\". Kubernetes also provides ways for containers to find and communicate with each other and ways to manage both tightly coupled and loosely coupled sets of cooperating containers.</p> <p>Señor Luis Daniel Ballesteros, Google Engineer, will give the talk.</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/e/8/e/600_385087822.jpeg\" /></p> <p>Our monthly GTUG meeting:</p> <p>6:30: Networking &amp; Snacks<br/>6:45: Lightning Talks/Demos</p> <p>- Jose Collas on using Go &amp; App Engine to do web development work: github.com/goatstone/</p> <p>7:00: Main Presentation <br/>8:00: Q&amp;A</p> ","how_to_find_us":"We are in the Park View Conference room enter across from PCC Natural Markets","visibility":"public"},{"created":1302629277000,"id":"qhgnjjysmbtb","name":"Polymer Web Components","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1410829200000,"local_date":"2014-09-15","local_time":"18:00","rsvp_open_offset":"PT744H","updated":1411596948000,"utc_offset":-25200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":128,"venue":{"id":1134758,"name":"Google Kirkland","lat":47.66958236694336,"lon":-122.1966323852539,"repinned":false,"address_1":"747 6th Street South","city":"Kirkland","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","phone":"(425) 739-5600&#8206;","zip":"98033","state":"WA"},"group":{"created":1253291446000,"name":"Google Developer Group (GDG) Seattle","id":1525894,"join_mode":"open","lat":47.599998474121094,"lon":-122.33000183105469,"urlname":"gdg-seattle","who":"Geeks","localized_location":"Seattle, WA","state":"WA","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Pacific"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdg-seattle/events/qhgnjjysmbtb/","manual_attendance_count":65,"description":"<p>Mike Koss (Google, Kirkland) will give an overview of <a href=\"http://www.polymer-project.org/\">Google Polymer</a>, a new web framework that helps developers use and share components as if they were new built-in HTML tags.</p> <p>We are planning a future event to give developers a hands-on experience writing client-side applications using Polymer; this talk will be a good intro to the topic.</p> <p>6:00: Networking &amp; Pizza <br/>6:30: Group Announcements <br/>6:40: Lightning Talks/Demos - (let us know in advance if you have something to show - 5 minutes) <br/>7:00: Main Presentation <br/>8:00: Q&amp;A</p> <p>There is free parking in the Google (surface) parking lot (under-building parking will be closed in the evening).  Parking spaces are limited, so please carpool if possible.  You can park in any available space (does not have to say \"visitor\") - just don't park in handicapped or expectant mothers parking - unless you are!</p> <p>Please enter Building A through the main reception (on the east side of the building - highlighted below).</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/1/b/a/600_408800922.jpeg\" /></p> <p>If parking is full - you can drive 1 block south to:</p> <p><a href=\"http://impacthubkirkland.com/\">Impact Hub Kirkland</a><br/>[masked]th Ave NE<br/>Kirkland, WA 98033</p> <p>and use their parking lot.</p> <p>Can't come in person - watch live <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/104304419342230315027/posts/fgukT4ErQmf\">Hangout on Air</a>.</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1411948361000,"duration":10800000,"id":"210120842","name":"Impact of Mobile on the Future of Retail","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1412123400000,"local_date":"2014-09-30","local_time":"17:30","updated":1412135418000,"utc_offset":-25200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":1,"venue":{"id":22660532,"name":"Bellevue City Hall","lat":47.61424255371094,"lon":-122.19357299804688,"repinned":false,"address_1":"450 110th Ave Ne","city":"Bellevue","country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA"},"group":{"created":1253291446000,"name":"Google Developer Group (GDG) Seattle","id":1525894,"join_mode":"open","lat":47.599998474121094,"lon":-122.33000183105469,"urlname":"gdg-seattle","who":"Geeks","localized_location":"Seattle, WA","state":"WA","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Pacific"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdg-seattle/events/210120842/","description":"<p>With leverage over pricing and distribution, producers and retailers had the upper hand in the past. Starting with the web, then mobile, and now digital payments, the retail sector has undergone profound transformation in the last decade. These technologies have made discovery, comparison shopping, and delivery easy and efficient. In 2014, it is the consumers that are firmly in control of their purchasing decisions leaving retailers competing for them and their wallets. Retailers that adapt to this customer-centric reality by connecting and engaging with consumers at every stage of the shopping process will be best positioned to survive and thrive. Retailers and their technology partners face challenging but exciting times ahead while they develop and deploy new innovative technologies and solutions to provide compelling and frictionless shopping experiences to their customers.</p> <p>As a premier community of entrepreneurs and investors in the Greater Seattle area, TiE Seattle is proud to organize a panel comprising of retail industry executives and entrepreneurs who are innovating in retail technologies and solutions. This panel will explore how mobile is shaping the future of retail and shed light on emerging opportunities and challenges. The panel will discuss topics such as mobile discovery; impact of showrooming; omni-channel retailing as it relates to addressing mobile users; mobile payments, checkout, and PoS; and impact of beacons on the shopping experience.</p> <p>The event begins at 5:30pm with networking and refreshments, followed by the panel discussion and Q&amp;A.</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1302629277000,"id":"qhgnjjysnbbc","name":"Learning to write Go","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1413855000000,"local_date":"2014-10-20","local_time":"18:30","updated":1413929282000,"utc_offset":-25200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":147,"venue":{"id":19299482,"name":"Google, Inc","lat":47.64925765991211,"lon":-122.35043334960938,"repinned":false,"address_1":"601 N 34th Street","city":"Seattle","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"","state":"WA"},"group":{"created":1253291446000,"name":"Google Developer Group (GDG) Seattle","id":1525894,"join_mode":"open","lat":47.599998474121094,"lon":-122.33000183105469,"urlname":"gdg-seattle","who":"Geeks","localized_location":"Seattle, WA","state":"WA","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Pacific"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdg-seattle/events/qhgnjjysnbbc/","description":"<p>Jeffrey Hulten will present a talk on <a href=\"https://github.com/jhulten/presentation-learning-golang/releases/tag/v20140601\">Learning to write Go</a>. </p> <p>Golang is getting a lot of attention for services and applications that need to support concurrency.

It was a great deal of fun, and now we're getting ready to do it again!</p> <p>The second Seattle VR Hackathon will be held over the weekend of September 25-27 at the University of Washington's Center for Education and Research in Construction at Sand Point - the same place as last time.</p> <p>This event will bring together people from industry and academia who are interested in VR and other complementary technologies to develop innovative solutions to the problems and challenges proposed by other attendees. It will provide an exploratory environment where disruption, innovation, and creative ideas can be brought to life. The focus of the event is to bring together crowd sourced knowledge for the advancement of virtual reality &amp; complementary tech. The event is organized by a local group of volunteers, and is backed by the Web3D consortium, with kind support from the UW's Department of Construction Management and a growing list of sponsors. General Information</p> <p>Registration costs $45 until Aug 24 and $65 thereafter. We will provide meals, drinks, and snacks throughout the weekend, and the best hacks will be awarded prizes.

Details will be made available on our website once we get things hammered out. <br/>* The VR Hackathon will be co-located with the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction hackathon. The events are separate, but we'll be sharing space and doing joint catering. If you're interested in AEC, there will be lots of people with problems and expertise to work with. If not, you can work on any VR problem that takes you interest. Our prize tracks are VR focused, just as usual.</p> <p>Frequently asked questions <br/>* \"Do I have to know how to develop for VR to come to this event?\" - No! While it would be helpful to have programming experience, there is plenty of room for people who are interested in design, graphics, sound, and more. Game engines like Unity and Unreal make it very easy to build up virtual environments, and there will be lots of developers there to help you if you need it.</p> <p>* \"Do I need my own VR headset?\" - No! Certainly, if you have one, you should bring it. VR applications can, however, be quite credibly developed to run on modern cell phones using devices such as the Samsung Gear VR headset and the Google Cardboard. To get a Cardboard frame, stop by <a href=\"https://www.google.com/get/cardboard/\"><a href=\"https://www.google.com/get/cardboard/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.google.com/get/cardboard/</a></a> and take a look.</p> <p>* \"Do I need to have a particular project to work on?\" - No! There will be lots of people there with ideas for projects that you can join. Similarly, if you have an idea but need someone to help you with it, there will be people there with skills that you can leverage and consult.</p> <p>* \"How do I learn about developing in VR?\" - There are many tutorials available online, and a good way to get started is to pick an engine such as Unity, Unreal, or Autodesk's new Stingray engine, and work through their tutorials. We're looking into the possibility of running a couple of \"VR crash courses\" on the weekend before the hackathon where we will help you quickly get to grips with one or more VR technologies so that you can participate. We'll be posting information on these options on our website, Facebook, and Twitter feeds as we have more information.</p> <p>We look forward to seeing you!</p> <p>Thanks, The Seattle VR Hackathon team - Greg, Trond, Mike, Karl, Damon, and Lucky.</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1443563631000,"duration":28800000,"id":"225709832","name":"Google Cloud Platform Fundamentals Training (Special GDG Session)","rsvp_limit":120,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1444492800000,"local_date":"2015-10-10","local_time":"09:00","updated":1444721681000,"utc_offset":-25200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":110,"group":{"created":1253291446000,"name":"Google Developer Group (GDG) Seattle","id":1525894,"join_mode":"open","lat":47.599998474121094,"lon":-122.33000183105469,"urlname":"gdg-seattle","who":"Geeks","localized_location":"Seattle, WA","state":"WA","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Pacific"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdg-seattle/events/225709832/","manual_attendance_count":0,"description":"<p>INSTRUCTIONS:</p> <p>• You will need photo ID to get through building security.</p> <p>• Please arrive between 8:30am and 9:00am so we can register and seat everyone in time. </p> <p>• The event begins PROMPTLY at 9am. </p> <p>• All participants must bring their own laptops (and chargers!!).

Its motivation is an on-going effort to make parallel programming more productive and accessible to a wider audience, without sacrificing performance. This talk will focus on why Chapel is a good solution for this problem.</p> <p><i>Lydia works for Cray Inc. developing language features for the Chapel team. She co-presented a half day tutorial on the language at SC15 (Super Computing Conference) in November.</i></p> <p><b>Interactive Visualization in R for Genomics by Kavita Garg</b></p> <p>Exploratory analysis is important starting point for multivariate genomic data. Exploratory Analysis helps identify key trends in the data, and is used to identify important metrics to use as input for deeper analysis. Visualizations are integral to identifying patterns both in exploratory and advanced analysis. Will show some examples of interactive principal component analysis (PCA) graphs and heatmaps from a public genomic dataset created using new tools available in R such as Shiny web application frameworks and htmlwidgets .  </p> <p><i>Kavita is Staff Scientist at computational biology group at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. She is the organizer of SAPWN (South Asian Women's Professional Network).</i></p> <p><b>A Swift Discussion on Grand Central Dispatch by Lesley Baker</b></p> <p>Grand Central Dispatch is Apple's library that provides support for concurrent code execution. We'll talk a bit high-level about why you might want multi-threaded support in your app (whether it be android or ios), what grand central dispatch is, and how you might use it in your Swift projects.   </p> <p><i>Lesley builds iOS and Android apps to help young kids understand and address their feelings. She spends a week in the summer teaching at App Camp for Girls.

It's for students, researchers, hobbyists, hackers, engineers, developers, inventors and innovators and is being open sourced under the <a href=\"http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\">Apache 2.0 open source license</a>.</p> <p>Why Did Google Open Source This?</p> <p>If TensorFlow is so great, why open source it rather than keep it proprietary? The answer is simpler than you might think: We believe that machine learning is a key ingredient to the innovative products and technologies of the future. Research in this area is global and growing fast, but lacks standard tools. By sharing what we believe to be one of the best machine learning toolboxes in the world, we hope to create an open standard for exchanging research ideas and putting machine learning in products. </p> <p>TensorFlow is not complete; it is intended to be built upon and extended. We have made an initial release of the source code, and continue to work actively to make it better. We hope to build an active open source community that drives the future of this library, both by providing feedback and by actively contributing to the source code. <a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/\"><a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.tensorflow.org/</a></a></p> <p>6:30 Networking &amp; Pizza <br/>6:45 Announcements <br/>7:00 Main Presentation <br/>8:xx: Q&amp;A </p> <p>Please note that this meetup happens in the main Google building.

The X-Lab is a tech-tank where crazy people, from scientists to artists, to developers to technologists, share their ideas in order to create moonshots. A moonshot is a radical solution, integrating breakthrough technology with native thinking. More than on projects we are exploring ambitions. If we do not like the way something is, we change it! I am also a GDE on Product Strategy and the lead of the GDG Thessaloniki as well as the promoter of GDGs in Greece. My goal is to be able to share my experiences with other enthusiasts and see them grow and achieve their dreams. Lately, just to brush up my memory and not lose the good habits, I am focusing a lot on ML and Deep Learning.</p> <p><b>About the Talk: </b><br/>I will share my experience working in my discomfort zone and how it helps me deliver breakthrough solutions with the hope that I can encourage others to push their limits. The project I'm going to share came out, almost, from a bet I made with George, an electrical &amp; computer engineer focused on Space Environments, who I met at the NASA Space Apps challenge in my town. We asked ourselves this question: How might we help astronauts not lose stuff in outer space? Well, in less than 2 weeks we organized a special NASA Design Sprint and gathered more than 20 people from different backgrounds to join us and share their thoughts/experiences on how to \"help\" NASA solve this big challenge. The Sprint helped us to \"space\" out of our comfi-zone and see things from a different angles and perspectives, delivering what (at least we think) is the best solution. Without a doubt I can tell you that the Sprint and the team demystified my structured thinking and helped all of us create a common vision for approaching the challenge. Of course we will need to have more Sprints in order to validate and start prototyping our solution, but the first Sprint made us all more engaged and helped take advantage of each of everyone's field of expertise! Join us next week to know more about the idea, the technologies and the prototypes we are thinking about.</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1417406942000,"id":"hbpsrmywjbzb","name":"Intro to TensorFlow","rsvp_limit":200,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1500339600000,"local_date":"2017-07-17","local_time":"18:00","updated":1500387536000,"utc_offset":-25200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":200,"venue":{"id":1079781,"name":"Google Fremont","lat":47.64866256713867,"lon":-122.35050201416016,"repinned":false,"address_1":"651 N 34th St","city":"Seattle","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","phone":"(206) 876-1800 ","zip":"98103","state":"WA"},"group":{"created":1253291446000,"name":"Google Developer Group (GDG) Seattle","id":1525894,"join_mode":"open","lat":47.599998474121094,"lon":-122.33000183105469,"urlname":"gdg-seattle","who":"Geeks","localized_location":"Seattle, WA","state":"WA","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Pacific"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdg-seattle/events/hbpsrmywjbzb/","manual_attendance_count":120,"description":"<p>Our monthly GDG meeting:</p> <p>6:00 Networking &amp; Pizza<br/>6:30 Announcements<br/>6:45 Main Presentation<br/>8:00 Q&amp;A</p> <p>This talk will  introduce <b>TensorFlow</b> and its ecosystem of related libraries, tools, and models, and discuss some of the ways it's being used for deep learning— both within Google, and in the larger OSS community.  In the process, we'll highlight some of the projects that are using TensorFlow, and give some fun demos.</p> <p><i>We will be taking attendance and track no-shows for this event.

In this second session of TensorFlow and Deep Learning without a PhD, Martin Gorner from Google will teach us recurrent neural networks. This is a joint event organized by Google Developer Group (GDG) Seattle and Seattle Data/Analytics/Machine Learning.</p> <p>The hottest topic in computer science today is machine learning and deep neural networks. Many problems deemed \"impossible\" only 5 years ago have now been solved by deep learning: playing GO, recognizing what is in an image, translating languages, … Software engineers are eager to adopt these new technologies as soon as they come out of research labs and the goal of this session is to equip you to do so. In this session we will cover the basic principles behind recurrent neural networks, the kind of neural networks used to precess sequences and natural language. We will focus on advanced RNN architectures powering real-world applications such as comment moderation or language translation. This session is a deep dive into the most recent advances in the field, such as attention mechanisms, and gives you tips, engineering best practices and pointers to apply in your own projects. No PhD required.</p> <p>There are two talks in the morning and a code lab in the afternoon. We have limited capacity for the codelab and the codelab is OPTIONAL. Attendees can feel free to leave after the morning talks or lunch. Event schedule:</p> <p>9:30 AM - Check in and breakfast<br/>10:00 AM - Talk by Martin Gorner - Tensorflow, deep learnining and recurrent neural networks<br/>11:00 AM - Talk by Martin Gorner - Tensorflow, deep learning and modern RNN architectures<br/>12:00 PM - Lunch<br/>1:00 PM - RNN codelab (optional), must bring your own computer for the codelab.<br/>3:00 PM - Wrap up</p> <p>*** Note: Must present your ticket to attend the event.

Codemagic is a free dedicated CI/CD service for Flutter. It was announced during Flutter live in December 2018 and has been growing and innovating ever since. Mikhail will demonstrate how to set up and configure workflows in Codemagic for publishing your Flutter apps to the app store and play store. Tips and custom scripts that showcase how developers have been using Codemagic will also be covered. During the Q&amp;A we can discuss specific use cases and answer detailed questions.</p> <p>Bios:</p> <p>Perris Davis<br/>Perris Davis is a software engineer at Capital One. He works on the mobile team here and really enjoys hacking away on small projects in his spare time away from hacking away at big projects. He serves on the board of Hacker Chat and regularly volunteers with the C1 Coders program. His favorite cake is probably carrot but he’s partial to tiramisu. You can reach out to him on GitHub and LinkedIn because he’s not gonna respond to your facebook friend request.</p> <p>Mikhail Tokarev<br/>Mikhail has worked as devops engineer for over 5 years. He is passionate about introducing devops practices into the development process in different teams. He joined Nevercode over a year ago and now leads architecture design of both Nevercode and Codemagic. He first saw Flutter in 2018 after Droidcon in Berlin and is excited about helping mobile developers around the world with seamless CI/CD experiences.</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1553637730000,"duration":10800000,"id":"260096152","name":"TensorFlow 2.0 & Documentation Sprint","rsvp_limit":135,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1554570000000,"local_date":"2019-04-06","local_time":"10:00","updated":1554583126000,"utc_offset":-25200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":131,"venue":{"id":26297617,"name":"Google Building C","lat":47.669647216796875,"lon":-122.19731140136719,"repinned":true,"address_1":"747 6th St South","city":"Kirkland","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"98033","state":"WA"},"group":{"created":1253291446000,"name":"Google Developer Group (GDG) Seattle","id":1525894,"join_mode":"open","lat":47.599998474121094,"lon":-122.33000183105469,"urlname":"gdg-seattle","who":"Geeks","localized_location":"Seattle, WA","state":"WA","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Pacific"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdg-seattle/events/260096152/","description":"<p>[Note: please bring your own computer.]</p> <p>TensorFlow 2.0 is a major release focused on ease of use and clarity while maintains its flexibility.

Week-long training times are a thing of the past and many models can now be trained in minutes in a notebook. Agility and fast iterations are bringing neural networks into regular software development cycles and many developers are ramping up on machine learning. This session will introduce TPUs, then dive deep into their microarchitecture secrets. It will also show you how to use them in your day-to-day projects to iterate faster. In fact, we will not just demo but train most of the models presented in this session on stage in real time, on TPUs.</p> <p>PARKING<br/>Only street parking is available.
