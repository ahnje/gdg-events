Google Cloud Platform (GCP) offers five APIs: Google Cloud Vision API, Cloud Speech API, Cloud Natural Language API, Cloud Translation API, and Cloud Video Intelligence API. These APIs access pre-trained machine learning models with a single API call. In this session, we share an overview of each API. Then we dive into code with a live demo.</p> <p>Allen Day is a Developer Advocate for Google Cloud. He's focused on healthcare and computational biology applications of AI and BigData technologies. Allen holds a PhD in Human Genetics from the School of Medicine at UCLA.</p> ","how_to_find_us":"Dialog Auditorium, Doctor Colvin R de Silva Mawatha, Colombo","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1514959130000,"duration":21600000,"id":"246437279","name":"Cloud Study Jam 2017","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1515814200000,"local_date":"2018-01-13","local_time":"09:00","rsvp_open_offset":"PT14H","updated":1515905349000,"utc_offset":19800000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":13,"venue":{"id":24447880,"name":"Dialog auditorium","lat":6.927079200744629,"lon":79.86124420166016,"repinned":false,"address_1":"15th Floor Auditorium, Dialog Axiata PLC Head Office, No 475, Union Place, Colombo 2","city":"Colombo","country":"lk","localized_country_name":"Sri Lanka"},"group":{"created":1501647637000,"name":"GDG Cloud Sri Lanka","id":25286827,"join_mode":"open","lat":6.929999828338623,"lon":79.8499984741211,"urlname":"GCDCLK","who":"Members","localized_location":"Colombo, Sri Lanka","state":"","country":"lk","region":"en_US","timezone":"Asia/Colombo"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GCDCLK/events/246437279/","manual_attendance_count":60,"description":"<p>Want to get started on the Google Cloud, but don't know where to begin?</p> <p>Join us for our Cloud Study Jam!
