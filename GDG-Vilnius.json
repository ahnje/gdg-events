We already see lots of teams moving to this very promising language. But in JetBrains we just don't want to stop on that. So we are working on Kotlin.Native, the same language, different backend. And one of the most promising applications for this backend is iOS development.</p> <p>In this talk I'll do short introduction into Kotlin language itself with description of some high level design ideas. Next step will be discussions around Native as a platform. I'll show you current complications with it and possible solutions. And finally we will go to iOS. You will see cross compiled Android/iOS example as well as example with just shared business logic. As a bonus I'll show you infinite possibilities about single language with all the parts, backend, frontend and two mobile apps.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>My name is Alexander Podkhalyuzin. I work for JetBrains from 2008 and 9 years I spent working on Scala plugin for IntelliJ IDEA. Last year I decided to go further and switched to Kotlin team, I started working on Kotlin.Native support in CLion and finished leading Kotlin tooling team, which includes general Kotlin support in IntelliJ IDEA and other IDEs.<br/>Before JetBrains I studied math quite successfully. That was one of my touches with Vilnius as I participated in Baltic Way math competition, where our team from St. Petersburg won. And that's not the all about my connection to the Lithuania as my mother born in Lithuania and Lithuanian is my second mother tongue language. So I'll try to do this talk in Lithuanian, the first time in my life, I hope it will be fun, so see you in Vilnius!</p> <p>Warm-up talk:<br/>Cross-Platform Knowledge<br/>Eligijus Starinskas (Trafi), Justas Medeišis (Trafi)</p> <p>At a lean startup with separate native Android and iOS apps and only a handful of mobile developers, we have explored both technical and human approaches to minimize duplicate work - thin clients, a shared C++ library, cross-functional teams. This experience has led us to a new standard for collaboration across Android and iOS developers inspired by domain-driven design. By working closely we 'steal' code from the other platform and do most of the work once without sacrificing the native language and development toolkit of each platform.</p> <p>This talk explores the challenges and benefits of collaborating closely across Android and iOS.<br/>- Common constraints on both mobile platforms, and what Android developers can learn from iOS community solutions.<br/>- Core similarities and differences between Kotlin and Swift, and how the languages help bridge communication across the two platforms.<br/>- Work practices and code principles that reduce the friction of cross-platform knowledge sharing.</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1525325335000,"duration":10800000,"id":"250401310","name":"Google IO 2018 Extended - Vilnius","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1525797000000,"local_date":"2018-05-08","local_time":"19:30","updated":1526062799000,"utc_offset":10800000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":100,"venue":{"id":25824630,"name":"Wix, Vinted and Swedbank IT HQ offices","lat":54.683223724365234,"lon":25.28602409362793,"repinned":false,"address_1":"3 great IT offices (see description)","city":"Vilnius","country":"lt","localized_country_name":"Lithuania"},"group":{"created":1512819919000,"name":"GDG Vilnius","id":26825483,"join_mode":"open","lat":54.70000076293945,"lon":25.270000457763672,"urlname":"GDG-Vilnius","who":"Members","localized_location":"Vilnius, Lithuania","state":"","country":"lt","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Vilnius"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Vilnius/events/250401310/","description":"<p>Doors open: 19:30<br/>Stream starts: 20:00</p> <p>Locations:<br/>- Wix (Didžioji g. 28, 3rd floor, <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/TxzrGzL1RkQ2\" class=\"linkified\">https://goo.gl/maps/TxzrGzL1RkQ2</a>, timelapse: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1039858902838831/permalink/1041942785963776/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.facebook.com/events/1039858902838831/permalink/1041942785963776/</a>)<br/>- Vinted HQ (Žirmūnų g. 70, 7th floor, <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/moQ4AhduHxS2\" class=\"linkified\">https://goo.gl/maps/moQ4AhduHxS2</a>, timelapse: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1039858902838831/permalink/1041943559297032/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.facebook.com/events/1039858902838831/permalink/1041943559297032/</a>)<br/>- Swedbank IT HQ (Perkūnkiemio g. 5, 2nd floor, <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/LZX8c51x67L2\" class=\"linkified\">https://goo.gl/maps/LZX8c51x67L2</a>, video: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1039858902838831/permalink/1041942135963841/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.facebook.com/events/1039858902838831/permalink/1041942135963841/</a>)</p> <p>We are inviting you to Google I/O 2018 Keynote live-streaming event.
