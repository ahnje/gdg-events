We will learn about Apache Beam, an open source programming model unifying batch and stream processing and see how Apache Beam pipelines can be executed in Google Cloud Dataflow, a fully-managed cloud service for batch and stream data processing. </p> <p><b>- Machine Learning APIs by Example, </b><i><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SRobTweets?lang=en\">Sara Robinson</a> (Google)</i></p> <p>Think your business could make use of Google's machine learning expertise when it comes to powering and improving your business applications, but do you get stuck on building and training your own custom model? Google Cloud Platform (GCP) offers four APIs: Google Cloud Vision API, Cloud Speech API, Cloud Natural Language API, and Cloud Translation API. These APIs access pre-trained machine learning models with a single API call. In this session, we'll share an overview of each API.

Two hottest topics in software development technology trends these days.

Craig started his career as a systems administrator, and has worked in development, deployment, DevOps, consulting, advisory and management roles.</p> <p>Talk 2:<br/>--------<br/>Ian Lewis (Developer Advocate, Google Cloud) - \"Kubernetes Security Best Practices\"</p> <p>Kubernetes has become the de-facto orchestration tool but it has some pitfalls to keep in mind with regard to security. How can we make containers more secure? How do we apply existing tools to our containers? How can we apply policy to containers so they only have access to what they need and nothing more? In this talk attendees will learn about specific security risks and see tools like PodSecurityPolicy, SELinux/AppArmor, and seccomp in action to mitigate those risks. Then we’ll go up the stack and learn how to apply network policy to containers and further improve security.</p> <p>Ian has had various developer and operations roles throughout his career and enjoys working in environments with diverse ways of thinking. Ian has been living in Tokyo since 2006 and is currently a Developer Advocate on the Google Cloud Platform team. He is passionate about DevOps, SRE, Python, Go, and container orchestration. When he's not writing controllers and operators in Go, he He runs the Kubernetes Meetup in Tokyo and blogs about Kubernetes and containers at www.ianlewis.org.</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1521689601000,"duration":7200000,"id":"248981640","name":"GCP Melbourne Meetup (June)","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1528963200000,"local_date":"2018-06-14","local_time":"18:00","updated":1529410781000,"utc_offset":36000000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":200,"venue":{"id":25386102,"name":"Shine Solutions","lat":-37.815860748291016,"lon":144.9560546875,"repinned":false,"address_1":"level 30, 600 bourke st","city":"Melbourne","country":"au","localized_country_name":"Australia"},"group":{"created":1497494416000,"name":"GDG Cloud Melbourne","id":24469920,"join_mode":"approval","lat":-37.810001373291016,"lon":144.9600067138672,"urlname":"GDG-Cloud-Melbourne","who":"GCP'ers in Melbourne","localized_location":"Melbourne, Australia","state":"","country":"au","region":"en_US","timezone":"Australia/Melbourne"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Cloud-Melbourne/events/248981640/","manual_attendance_count":100,"description":"<p>Join us for talks on Cloud Spanner and Tensorflow!<br/>Doors open for drinks at 6:00pm, and talks will kickoff at 6:30pm.
