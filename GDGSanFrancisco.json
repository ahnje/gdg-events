This ain't Picasso’s canvas. HTML5's Canvas2D context provides an interface to draw all the primitives (lines, arcs, text) that we’d expect along with a powerful API for doing rotation, scalar, and translation transformations. You can even use it as area to composite images and do pixel manipulation. Compared to its younger more powerful and processor intensive cohort WebGL, Canvas is more likely to be supported by computers with limited CPU or GPU resources.</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/9/2/2/event_88878722.jpeg\" /></p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>________________________</p> <p><b>Agenda</b></p> <p><i>10:30- 11:00am</i> - Check In</p> <p><i>11:00- 1:00</i> - <b>Codelab 1</b> - Jonathan Smiley | How to Rapidly Prototype for Multiple Devices<a href=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2769131/foundation-mozilla.pdf\">.</a></p> <p><i>1:00 - 2:00</i> - Catered Lunch* with a short intro to Dart</p> <p><i>2:00 - 4:00</i> - <b>Codelab 2</b> - Estelle Wey | Mobile +Massive Overview of CSS3</p> <p><i>4:00 - 6:00</i> - <b>Codelab 3</b> - James Williams | Canvas, SVG, WebGL</p> <p>________________________</p> <p><i>*please dont forget to tell us if you would prefer a vegetarian meal</p> <p></i> <b>Sponsors </b></p> <p><i>Venue Sponsor</i></p> <p><i><img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/c/b/0/event_85420112.jpeg\" /></i>DevBootCamp is a San Francisco Training Facility, specializing in 10 week bootcamps! </p> <p> </p> <p>Gold Sponsor<br/><i>Kontagent </i></p> <p>In-Kind Sponsor<br/><i>O'Reilly Media</i></p> <p><i><br/></i></p> ","how_to_find_us":"We are on the Second floor, Look for a Meetup Logo or the GTUG logo!","visibility":"public"},{"created":1328645571000,"id":"51433652","name":"Android DevCamp 2012 Planning +Hangout","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1328842800000,"local_date":"2012-02-09","local_time":"19:00","updated":1328847512000,"utc_offset":-28800000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":9,"group":{"created":1317930262000,"name":"GDG San Francisco @sf_gdg","id":2603182,"join_mode":"open","lat":37.790000915527344,"lon":-122.41000366210938,"urlname":"GDGSanFrancisco","who":"Techies","localized_location":"San Francisco, CA","state":"CA","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Pacific"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDGSanFrancisco/events/51433652/","description":"<p>GTUGsf is holding a public planning +hangouts for our upcoming Android DevCamp. </p> <p> </p> <p>The +Hangout Link:</p> <p><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/hangouts/extras/talk.google.com/san-francisco-gtug?authuser=0&amp;hl=en&amp;eid=\"><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/hangouts/extras/talk.google.com/san-francisco-gtug?authuser=0&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;eid\" class=\"linkified\">https://plus.google.com/hangouts/extras/talk.google.com/san-francisco-gtug?authuser=0&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;eid</a>=</a></p> <p> </p> <p>Quick Hangout Plugin Installation Tutorial OSX + Chrome</p> <p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/present/view?id=dcxcq4hf_12f7kmn6fv&amp;interval=10\"><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/present/view?id=dcxcq4hf_12f7kmn6fv&amp;interval=10\" class=\"linkified\">https://docs.google.com/present/view?id=dcxcq4hf_12f7kmn6fv&amp;interval=10</a></a></p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>Preliminary Outline<br/>(1) GTUGsf Member Q&amp;A<br/>(2) Announcements re: sponsorship<br/>(3) GTUGsf community outreach.  <br/>(3a) We have a hand full of Developer passes for Experienced Android Programmers [dev link here today]<br/>(3b) well as lesson passes (good for specific sessions only)</p> <p>[lesson link here today]<br/>(4) Review Publicly listed Hackathon Projects!

These devices come with different capabilities and constraints, such as input style or screen size, resolution and form. We can no longer design with only desktop in mind. We need to rapidly prototype for multiple devices to see if our designs fly on four-corner screens of different sizes. We'll take you through solutions using <a href=\"http://foundation.zurb.com/\">Foundation</a>, our CSS/HTML/JS framework, to quickly prototype sites and web apps that work on any device, at any resolution, with a variety of capabilities and constraints. We'll also take you through the whys and hows of the decisions we make along the way.</p> <p><b>Android + Robotics</b> sounds like an obvious match!

You can even meet his friend, a <b>Walking Robot.</b></p> <p><b>StartupWeekend Pitch Workshop -</b> Ahmed Siddoqui has earned invaluable experience guiding startup teams through large scale events like Mega, Demo, and Launch.

The Dart VM is adding experimental support for Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) operations. SIMD operations unlock the full performance of CPUs by performing 4 operations at once. That's a 4x speedup. Every smart phone, tablet, and PC includes a SIMD processor which sits unused. Come learn about Dart, SIMD, and making your web software fast.</p> <p><b>About John McCutchan</b></p> <p><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/d/6/a/event_200175722.jpeg\" /></p> <p>John is a Developer Programs Engineer at Google.

Before that, she worked in Google Developer Relations, and graduated from USC's Computer Science Department (Go Trojans!).</p> <p><b>Feature Detection in the Real World</b></p> <p>In an ideal world, we would always use feature detection to decide what features to serve our users. Unfortunately, in the real world, there are practical problems with that approach: some features are undetectable, some tests take too long, and sometimes, its just not worth the time to do them. In this talk, I'll introduce the ideas and tools behind feature detection and then discuss where we've tried to use it at Coursera and where we failed.</p> <p><img src=\"http://static.lanyrd.net/cropped-profile-photos/76dc557d127db77ce88217206174aaee038ee431-s300.jpg\" /></p> <p><b>Chiu-Ki Chan</b></p> <p>Chiu-Ki flows between both web and mobile development. At Google, she worked on the javascript frontend for Book Search, and the native Android client for Google Mobile Maps. Afterwards, she went to two different web startups, one with Django the other with Ruby on Rails, both using jquery to build interactive websites.

You must know how to program, but no previous knowledge of Dart is required.</p> <p>During this Code Lab you will have the opportunity to explore Dart on the client side or the server side—or both. You will go through the process of building one or two simple applications in Dart, using Dart tools such as Dart Editor. The finished web application will run in all modern browsers and, together with the server-side part, will be ready to deploy.</p> <p>Even Dart experts will get something from this Code Lab: a chance to try out a brand new server-side code lab, mingle with Dart engineers, and get demos of some of Google’s Dart projects, all in a relaxed atmosphere with food and beer. Scheduled demos include sky (the UI part of the open source Mojo project) and DartPad (an interactive Dart playground, with an open source client &amp; server).

We are founders of Nodelab, which was selected by Tech Crunch as one of the best technological startups from Europe. We are heading to San Francisco to meet with you during TC Disrupt and this meetup! :) </p> <p>About Nodelab and Luna: Nodelab is a collaborative whiteboard allowing people of different professions to create software, process large amount of data and interactively visualize the results. It shortens the time needed to develop, deploy and maintain domain specific solutions for IoT, Data Science, Microservices integration and others. </p> <p>It is powered by a new programming language Luna, which provides interchangeable textual and visual syntax representation, which efficiently bridges the communication gap between developers and non-developers, allows for faster refactoring, visual profiling and interactive google-docs like collaboration. </p> <p>In the first hours after its announcement it took the 1st place on both Hackernews and has been hailed \"A programming language to end all programming languages\". </p> <p>More information can be found: </p> <p>On the official website: <a href=\"http://www.luna-lang.org\">www.luna-lang.org</a></p> <p>2-minute example video of simple IoT system in Nodelab: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76zdGNkNna0\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76zdGNkNna0\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76zdGNkNna0</a></a></p> <p>During this meetup we'd love to discuss with you applications of Luna in real-world use cases and exchange ideas about the possibilities it creates.

Its proven to have better performance in spheres which deal with a lot of human interaction, and the cooking of food is one such domain. In this talk, I shall explore the various elements that come in play when food is cooked. Zooming out from molecular level changes that take place due to the application of heat, to various sensor information that we observe, the complex process of cooking food is broken down. What remains to be answered is whether this can be achieved by a connected system. Can an intelligent system learn to cook food? Talk: ChromePad - Chromium OS for ThinkPads</p> <p>Description: Step-by-step on how to build Chromium OS from source, make a USB installer, and then install Chromium OS on a ThinkPad (hard drive installation). After installing Chrome OS on a ThinkPad we can walk through how to install Debian in a crouton(Chromium OS Universal Chroot Environment), and configure for Android development. The end result is essentially a slightly more capable/slightly less secure Chromebook that costs next to nothing, and is IMO extremely cool. There are all sorts of features supported by Chromium OS that can be enabled, like the cellular modem, bluetooth and fingerprint reader.</p> <p>About the Speakers:</p> <p>Ronica Jethwa is a Machine Intelligence engineer at June, where she develops deep learning models for June’s hardware products.

But high-quality bot experiences are very hard to build. Certain issues in particular make building bots that do not frustrate users difficult. This presentation will delve into such issues and suggest ways, including machine learning, for developers to save time addressing them.</p> <p>Talk: RxJava Extended: Writing Your First Custom Operator<br/>Description: RxJava is a fantastically powerful library/framework, and for the vast majority of use cases, you can live happily with FlatMap, TakeUntil, and Debounce. However, there comes a time when you'll need to roll up your sleeves and extend RxJava's functionality. Maybe you want to extend a library or API to make it “reactive” (like Retrofit) -- or maybe you just want to componentize a network connectivity listener to handle your IOExceptions. In either case, you'll need to face your inner reactive demons and write some custom operators. But don’t worry! In this talk, we’ll walk through how to create a small library to bridge MaterialDialogs into the Reactive Streams world. At the end of this talk, you'll have learned how to:<br/>1. implement your first custom operator<br/>2. how NOT to implement custom operators (e.g,. \"just use Observable.create\")<br/>3. avoid memory leaks and other pitfalls in standard + custom RxJava code<br/>Note: It is recommended that you have at least a basic understanding of RxJava for this talk. If you know the difference between an Observable and Disposable, you'll be just fine :)<br/>(Even if you aren’t 100% sure, come anyway and walk away with some cool RxJava knowledge!)</p> <p>About the Speakers:</p> <p>Ofer Ronen leads the Chatbase bot analytics team within Area 120.

In this talk, David Szabo will introduce about an open source project to implement end-to-end encryption on top of Firebase/Firestore, making Firebase one of the most secure cloud platforms out there. End-to-End Encryption also enables healthcare apps to run encrypted chats on the platform that meet HIPAA's requirements. The talk will cover the basic principle of how an end-to-end encrypted key management works, how keys can be distributed securely between users with open source libraries and how end-users can own the keys without noticing any extra overhead. A sample iOS and Android app/source will be used to demonstrate parts of the solution and outline how HIPAA deals with data encryption.</p> <p>Talk: End to End Machine Learning<br/>Description: We will start by developing a ML model using TensorFlow, training and deploying it on Google Cloud and then finally use it to get inferences.</p> <p>About the Speakers:</p> <p>David Szabo is a Privacy activist &amp; crypto(graphy) nerd: I'm working on making and end to data breaches. In my third startup, Virgil Security, I'm building a framework for developers to simplify the implementation of perfect user privacy in healthcare, IoT and other products. Earlier in my career, I spent 12 years at Microsoft across 4 countries in various engineering, UX, business and leadership roles.</p> <p>Vikram Tiwari is co-founder of Omni Labs based in San Francisco which aims to bring data analytics and machine learning in marketing space.

The 3 major things we’ll be exploring are:<br/>1. Particle Physics: A gentle introduction to particle physics and how the large hadron collider works.<br/>2. Particle identification: training a classifier to detect electrons, protons, muons, kaons and pions and other particles.<br/>3. Searching for dark matter: training a neural network to distinguish between background noise and the signal, and then applying clustering algorithms to find potential traces of dark matter in this signal.</p> <p>About our speaker:<br/>Lavanya is a machine learning engineer who began working on AI 10 years ago when she founded ACM SIGAI at Purdue University as a sophomore. In a past life, she taught herself to code at age 10, and built her first startup at 14.
