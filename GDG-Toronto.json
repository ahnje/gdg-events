One of these new tools were <b>Fragments</b> - a new Android building block that sits next to Activities, Services, and all the other basic needs of every application.</p> <p>With 3.x+ devices out, Fragments are now one of the most important parts of your Android development experience. Knowing this tool inside out will make it significantly easier for you to build apps that scale on different kinds of devices.</p> <p>So if you've been making Android applications and want to learn how to make apps that work great in the new framework, come down to the GTUG Fragments Workshop!</p> <p>This workshop will be run by <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/111531118192938544384\">Anuj Ahooja</a>, an Android developer who has meddled with both phones and tablets for the past year and a half and has learned the ins and outs of Android development whether it be 2.x, 3.x, or 4.x.</p> <p> </p> <p><b>PREREQUISITES:</b></p> <p>Have a good understanding of Android development - it will be assumed that you can make a basic Android application very quickly. This is vital as we'll be moving really fast through basic Android concepts and you don't have a good hold of it, you'll fall behind and lose out. Eclipse + Android SDK 3.x+ (get 4.x+ for fake bonus points). Passion to learn, discuss, and share development knowledge.  </p> <p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b> There is <b>very limited space</b> for this workshop, so unless you're 95% sure that you're coming, please don't sign up.

Going beyond SDK quirks and workarounds — even as far as pricing and how an app scales with 100k user-growth in a single week. Further topics being covered: Databases, Android SDK, Analytics, Crash logs, pricing, usage optimization and monitoring (external tools and data schema). And a brief introduction to new features including how to take advantage of them in the best way possible. If you are currently using Firebase, or you are about to, save yourself hours of pointless key smashing! </p> <p><b>About Michal Tajchert</b></p> <p>Michal has been an Android developer for over 6 years, and is a Firebase heavy user. Michal has used Firebase in four mobile apps (from 1k users to 0.3m), won Google's award for best app in Europe with Firebase (Kanarek). He is the author of 12Hours, Pola, and the Kanarek apps. Currently, Michal is the CEO of <a href=\"http://icelytics.io/\">Icelytics.io</a>: a way to optimize and monitor performance of mobile apps. </p> <p>Michael is a follower of the Conjoined Triangles of Success, Serial entrepreneur and hackathon hacker; he’s always searching for new growth hacking opportunities and to share knowledge through mentorship and public speaking.</p> <p><b>2) Video Processing on Android</b></p> <p>Overlays, transcoding and cropping are just a few of the challenges you face when working with video on-device. In this talk I will go through my experience experimenting with built-in as well as third party libraries for video processing on Android. </p> <p><b>About Namrata Bandekar</b></p> <p>Namrata is an iOS Engineer at OANDA and does native Android development as a side hustle.

Machine Learning: beyond the buzzword</p> <p>2. Understanding the problems that Machine Learning can and cannot solve</p> <p>3. Where Machine Learning fits in our current world</p> <p>4. Identifying a Machine Learning Problem</p> <p>5.
