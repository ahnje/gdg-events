In this introductory talk, we'll explain what functional, reactive programming is, how it pertains to Angular (hint: you're probably already writing reactive code) and how it can make your applications better.

With Flutter, you'll write your applications in Dart, a programming language from Google. No need to fret though - if you have familiarity with Java, JavaScript or C# style of languages you'll feel right at home. Flutter's framework is heavily influenced by React and this makes declaring and programming applications quick and easy. In this session we'll build a Flutter application from the ground up which targets both Android and iOS, all through Android Studio.</p> <p>Donn Felker is a independent consultant who has written multiple books on Android Development.
