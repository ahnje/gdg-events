The kind where you close the door and cry. Over time I’ve realized how much those hard times have helped me grow. I’d like to share three stories from my career and lessons learned that may be helpful to other women in technology.</p> <p>---</p> <p>Token Women: Why Representation in the Blockchain Space Matters<br/>Jamie Iguchi</p> <p>Blockchain technology will revolutionize all aspects of society and business, and women are uniquely positioned to harness its power for good. Any business, nonprofit venture, or idea can benefit from it. We are at the earliest stages of this this paradigm shift; if more women don't get in on the ground level, they will be sidelined.</p> <p>---</p> <p>SVD in Text and Image Analysis: How much information do we really need?<br/>Briana Young</p> <p>Singular Value Decomposition is a dimension reduction technique widely used in statistical and machine learning strategies, enabling the user to reduce redundant or irrelevant information while retaining the essence of a dataset. Want to creepily stare into the soul of your data? Use SVD.</p> <p>---</p> <p>Use What Your Momma Gave Ya<br/>Amy Devin</p> <p>It's time to stop trying to man up at work. Learn how traditionally feminine skillsets and strengths are precisely what make tech teams stronger. We'll talk about about empathy, relationship building, intuition and other \"soft skills\" that make your projects more successful and you more hirable.</p> <p>---</p> <p>Pixel Perfect Cookies - Lightning Talk<br/>Kelsey Iverson</p> <p>What is a cookie? Why do I have so many of them? Hear a simplified explanation of common things going on behind the scenes of almost every recognizable \"brand\" website through strategically placed pixels. If you have ever wondered how Facebook knew that you were looking to buy a new Subaru Crosstrek, it's probably crumb related.</p> ","how_to_find_us":"3rd floor of the building across the parking lot from the main onX building.
