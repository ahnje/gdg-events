The Design team at Google has created a framework named Human-Centered Machine Learning (HCML) to help us focus and guide that understanding. I will introduce this concept and show how you can use it in your development process.</p> <p>I will show how HCML can be used to answer important questions like: Is ML right for this problem? What unique solution does ML provide? Are we using the right information to train our system? What is the impact of wrong results?</p> <p>Just like with the web and mobile revolutions, ML will force us to consider new possibilities for every experience we build. We must stay grounded in human needs while solving them in unique ways. HCML provides techniques to help us accomplish this.</p> <p>Schedule<br/>-------------<br/>6:00 - 6:45 - Eat, Meet, &amp; Greet<br/>6:45 - 7:00 - Introduction / Announcements<br/>7:00 - 7:45 - Human + Machine Learning<br/>7:45 - 8:15 - Questions...</p> <p>About the Speaker<br/>-------------------------<br/>Google Developer Expert in Android Mike Wolfson is a product-focused developer working in Phoenix.

What does it mean?<br/>After looking at way too many definitions of the word, I noticed that virtually everyone one of them used the word \"new\". However, there's a flaw in using that to guide us because it makes us feel that to do something, anything, innovative, we must come up with something totally new and unrelated to anything that came before.<br/>While it's true that we can find examples of completely revolutionary ideas throughout history, I believe that innovation, by and large, comes from putting together existing tools, ideas, and processes. This is especially true in machine learning and AI. The field is changing so fast, growing and shifting through the recombination of \"new\" ideas, tools, and processes.</p> <p>We are going to focus on some of the tools that you can use to bring machine learning to your products and workflows. I look forward to what amazing \"innovations\" you bring to your field!</p> <p>Along with this presentation, we have a Cloud StudyJam.
