Mobile web development can be a gnarly beast from a code perspective, but how much time do you give to the experience the folks using your application will have? Boilerstrapping Usability for Android will give you some quick routes when \"we've run out of time/budget\" comes up in conversations about usability. Maybe you don't have a dedicated resource on your team… we'll go over some self-starter activities you can do yourself on a bar napkin… that is, if you choose that route. Maybe we'll spend the entire time looking at design conventions… or just complaining about why it took them so long to move to a consistent (ish) experience across devices. This presentation will be interactive in the style of the choose-your-own-adventure books of old, so show up ready to help steer because by the end, Chris prefers that the blame (err… success) is shared all around.</p> <p> </p> <p><b>About Chris</b></p> <p>Who is this Chris guy? He's an experience designer and interface developer for ThoughtWorks, a community of passionate individuals looking to do the best software design and delivery while advocating for positive social change along the way. He's a proponent of mobile-first thinking (when appropriate) and tries to close the loop between feedback, design, and development as close as the laws of physics will allow. He's been venturing around for the past few years working with startups and companies on MVP development, pivots, and other such things with an emphasis on Science and user input.

creepiest) things about our phone is that it usually knows where we are in the world based on our coordinates in the GPS (Global Positioning System).  With that data we can make our apps do some pretty cool things!  Geofences define a GPS point and a radius in meters to create \"triggers\" for action.  I will show you how to setup the Google Maps API and add geofences to any application.</p> <p>About Bill Mote:<br/>Bill was a lifelong infrastructure nerd with a passion for making things better, faster and more reliable.  The DevOps world just didn't give him enough heads down coding time so when Android hit the scene Bill decided to forgo his safety net and start developing for Android full time.  In addition to a handful of his own utility apps, Bill has built apps for startups and Fortune 50s alike with contributions to more than a dozen apps currently available in the Play Store.  Bill is the co-organizer of our Cincy Android Meetup as well as GDG Cincinnati and truly enjoys both the teachings and learnings he gets out of them.</p> <p>Unable to attend?

developer, or you’re just getting started, you will need to think about storing data on the device. Android offers several options including relational data storage on a SQLite Database, but the APIs and examples provided by Google look like the state-of-the-art JDBC programming you did back in 1995! In this talk, you’ll learn how to use RealmDB, an elegant Object Relational database alternative to SQLite, to make database development on Android fun, easy, and testable.</p> <p>Eric Maxwell is a Principal Engineer at Credible Software.
