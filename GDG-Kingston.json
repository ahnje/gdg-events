Technological advancements have bred a new suite of tools that have made communication and collaboration seamless no matter your timezone, language or background.

How can we as a city prepare our youth to become exporters of tech talent? What will be the economic impact if we spend the next 5 - 10 years sowing seeds of tech expertise in our schools?
