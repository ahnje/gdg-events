We're focusing on creating an all-inclusive environment and are aimed primarily at women, however, this event is open to all.</p> <p>Why attend?</p> <p> Techstars Global Startup Weekend is where passionate people can come together to get things done; to learn, network, bridge the gap between trades, expose potential and see actual results. New York Women edition is designed to engage more entrepreneurs and provide them with the necessary resources for long-term success. The weekend will be focused on empowering more women within our community to lend their voices to innovation. It will be one of over 50 Startup Weekends happening around the globe, and the winning team will qualify to attend our global (in-person) demo day with other #globalswwomen winning teams.</p> <p>Why Women edition? </p> <p>Our aim is to involve more women in the startup world. We have seen the barriers faced by women in tech and we would like to cultivate a wholly inclusive community. Women still don't fill enough important roles in tech. Women hold under a quarter (24%) of senior roles across the world and 5.2% of CEO positions at S&amp;P 500 Companies. Closing the wage gap for women would add $28 trillion to global GDP. As tech lovers, women and entrepreneurs, it is our responsibility to grow female representation, in NYC and around the world!</p> <p>How it works </p> <p>Beginning with Friday night, women pitch their startup idea and receive feedback from their peers. Teams organically form around the top ideas followed by a 54-hour of business model creation, coding, designing, and market validation. Startup Weekends culminate in Sunday night demos and presentations with presentations in front of local entrepreneurial leaders providing another opportunity for critical feedback before a final winning team is chosen.</p> <p>Get your tickets here! please visit <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/techstars-startup-weekend-women-nyc-tickets-66498784655\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/techstars-startup-weekend-women-nyc-tickets-66498784655</a></p> ","how_to_find_us":"There will be a volunteer downstairs to help with the door","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1569869659000,"duration":86400000,"id":"265292835","name":"All Day DevOps, Streaming Live Online - November 6, 2019","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1573027200000,"local_date":"2019-11-06","local_time":"03:00","updated":1573116900000,"utc_offset":-18000000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":31,"venue":{"id":26658299,"name":"Live Online","lat":40.74247741699219,"lon":-74.0060043334961,"repinned":false,"address_1":"youtube live stream","city":"New York","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"10011","state":"ny"},"is_online_event":false,"group":{"created":1412943511000,"name":"GDG Cloud NYC","id":17528982,"join_mode":"open","lat":40.7400016784668,"lon":-74,"urlname":"cloudnyc","who":"Cloudies","localized_location":"New York, NY","state":"NY","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Eastern"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/cloudnyc/events/265292835/","description":"<p>PLEASE NOTE: You can confirm your interest on this meetup group, but you'll need to register for the event on All Day DevOps in order to have access to the 150 live sessions and the recordings afterward: AllDayDevOps.com.</p> <p>On November 6, 2019, we'll be participating in All Day DevOps, a live online, streaming event, featuring over 140 speakers from around the world talking about their experiences implementing DevOps and DevSecOps within their companies.
