At least one proprietary library is available with a US$1000 license for ONE application for ONE developer. What about free and open source software? Apache POI seems to be the best answer and Apache POI HSSF (Excel 97) works fine on Android, but Apache POI XSSF (Excel 2007) won’t work out of the box because of 65K methods limit and some other issues. Dynamic class loading is not the solution in this case. We’ll walk through the process of making XSSF work on Android.</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1414105052000,"duration":7200000,"id":"215269872","name":"GDG Auckland November Meetup","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1415251800000,"local_date":"2014-11-06","local_time":"18:30","updated":1415264426000,"utc_offset":46800000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":8,"group":{"created":1407442232000,"name":"GDG Auckland","id":16249912,"join_mode":"open","lat":-36.849998474121094,"lon":174.75999450683594,"urlname":"GDGAuckland","who":"GDGers","localized_location":"Auckland, New Zealand","state":"","country":"nz","region":"en_US","timezone":"Pacific/Auckland"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDGAuckland/events/215269872/","manual_attendance_count":8,"description":"<p>This month +Josh Burton will talk about Recycler View, a flexible view for providing a limited window into large datasets on Android.</p> <p>There will also be general discussion about the Android 5 Lollipop release, and the new Nexus devices.﻿</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1416856777000,"duration":7200000,"id":"218876284","name":"GDG Auckland -
