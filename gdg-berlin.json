Spinnaker – the successor of Asgard and an open-source project as well – is a complete reimplementation of its predecessor and heavily improved. It adopts a key best practice of immutable servers, lets users reason at the level of services and deployment strategies, and works across multiple cloud providers, including Google Cloud Platform. This unbeatable combination of capabilities prepares software so that you can confidently deploy your system to production at any time.</p> <p>The talk introduces Spinnaker and the challenges it's trying to solve. We will also demonstrate an actual deployment workflow consisting of several Spinnaker pipelines.</p> <p>See you there on Wednesday!</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1456079841000,"duration":10800000,"id":"229021639","name":"Sunday Firebase Brunch","rsvp_limit":60,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1456657200000,"local_date":"2016-02-28","local_time":"12:00","updated":1456871011000,"utc_offset":3600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":55,"venue":{"id":4802072,"name":"Immobilien Scout GmbH","lat":52.51259231567383,"lon":13.431108474731445,"repinned":false,"address_1":"Andreasstraße 10","city":"10243 Berlin","country":"de","localized_country_name":"Germany"},"group":{"created":1312720067000,"name":"Google Developer Group Berlin (GDG Berlin)","id":2303271,"join_mode":"open","lat":52.52000045776367,"lon":13.380000114440918,"urlname":"gdg-berlin","who":"Google Developers","localized_location":"Berlin, Germany","state":"","country":"de","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Berlin"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdg-berlin/events/229021639/","description":"<p>Join us for a very special event: Geeky brunch while learning a new technology.

With a new technology \"Web Bluetooth\", our web apps are finally able to communicate directly with Physical Devices and control them. Whether it is a heart-rate sensor, a BB-8 robot, or your smart refrigerator - Web Bluetooth got you covered. In this talk, we will learn the basics of the underlying Bluetooth Low Energy technology, then cover the Web Bluetooth APIs, and finally engage in a live demo where we will control a Smart Light Bulb, as well as a cute 3D-printed Robot, directly from a web page.</p> <p>In addition to this talk, we would love to see what you have been building following our Progressive Web App event last month. If you have something you'd like to demo, please get in touch with us prior to the event.</p> <p>For this GDG Berlin meetup, The Factory will be hosting us.</p> <p>We are looking forward to seeing you there!</p> ","how_to_find_us":"Event space on the 1st floor","visibility":"public"},{"created":1473069522000,"duration":10800000,"id":"kknqxlyvmblc","name":"WTM Berlin GoBridge","rsvp_limit":40,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1475082000000,"local_date":"2016-09-28","local_time":"19:00","updated":1475095244000,"utc_offset":7200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":39,"venue":{"id":20618232,"name":"SoundCloud HQ","lat":52.53683853149414,"lon":13.394927978515625,"repinned":false,"address_1":"Rheinsberger Straße 76/77","city":"Berlin","country":"de","localized_country_name":"Germany"},"group":{"created":1312720067000,"name":"Google Developer Group Berlin (GDG Berlin)","id":2303271,"join_mode":"open","lat":52.52000045776367,"lon":13.380000114440918,"urlname":"gdg-berlin","who":"Google Developers","localized_location":"Berlin, Germany","state":"","country":"de","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Berlin"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdg-berlin/events/kknqxlyvmblc/","description":"<p>Welcome to Golang GoBridge workshop for WTM Berlin!</p> <p><a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/54d13f55e4b0c5340ae28f6a/54d14222e4b087ce29a2bfc3/54e613f1e4b03f7bcf2f14d3/1424364644965/?format=1000w\" class=\"linkified\">https://static1.squarespace.com/static/54d13f55e4b0c5340ae28f6a/54d14222e4b087ce29a2bfc3/54e613f1e4b03f7bcf2f14d3/1424364644965/?format=1000w</a></p> <p>This is part of our 3 months workshop, where we will meet twice a month to learn coding principals using Golang, during September-December in SoundCloud HQ.</p> <p>The programs involved:</p> <p>GoBridge is dedicated to building bridges that educate and empower underrepresented communities to teach technical skills and foster diversity in tech:  <a href=\"https://golangbridge.org/\"><a href=\"https://golangbridge.org/\" class=\"linkified\">https://golangbridge.org/</a></a></p> <p><img src=\"https://golangbridge.org/images/go-bridge-logo-transparent.png\" /></p> <p>Women Techmakers is Google's brand and global program for women in tech:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.womentechmakers.com/\"><a href=\"https://www.womentechmakers.com\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.womentechmakers.com</a></a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/1106085959408694/permalink/1327998240550797/\">Join WTM Berlin on facebook </a></p> <p><img src=\"https://a248.e.akamai.net/secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/3/c/e/600_453813742.jpeg\" /></p> <p>The Berlin chapter of WTM runs 2 study groups:</p> <p>1. <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/gdgberlin/events/233414805/\">Android Study Jam</a> <br/>2.

The use of port 80 or port 443 for the majority of communication between services renders network port filtering based security almost entirely useless. Even the short lived nature containers is causing problems as traditional networking tools struggle due the short lifecycle of an IP address. Layer 4 loadbalancers are being replaced by HTTP request aware proxies to provide more meaningful operation such as rewriting URLs, route based on headers, or perform HTTP compression.</p> <p>This talk takes a deep dive into Cilium, a function aware service fabric that provides a communication mechanism between your services and containers with the ability to gain visibility and control at function level (HTTP requests, REST APIs, gRPC, datastore interactions, ...). Instead of allowing port numbers and IP addresses, your policy will whitelist specific API calls from services identified by labels, limit datastore interactions to whitelisted keys or tables, and specify routing rules based on HTTP headers.</p> <p>Cilium is built with the powers of BPF, one of the most promising low level technologies in the Linux kernel. It enables Cilium to not only provide efficient communication and control by generating BPF programs specifically tailored to services and containers, it can also leverage BPF to collect metrics from the operating system and associate them with individual function calls being recorded on the network. If you ever wondered how many block IO calls a particular REST API call made to a service has caused, you can find out now.</p> <p><b>\"How Clustering Technologies Drive Organizational Efficiency,\"</b> Joe Beda &amp; Craig McLuckie</p> <p><b>Abstract:</b> The presentation will center around the emerging world of cloud native operations and how clustering technologies (like Kubernetes) drive organizational efficiency as much as they do infrastructure efficiency. This talk will compare and contrast different operations and organizational maturity models.</p> <p><b>\"Kubernetes 1.6,\" </b>Kelsey Hightower</p> <p><b>Abstract: </b>In this talk, Kelsey will take a look at Kubernetes 1.6 and explore a few new features such as:</p> <p>* autoscaling with custom metrics<br/>* custom schedulers<br/>* RBAC<br/>* The Kubernetes CRI</p> <p>---------------------------------------------</p> <p><b>SPEAKER BIOS:</b></p> <p><b>Kelsey Hightower</b>, Developer Advocate at Google (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower\">@kelseyhightower</a>) - Kelsey Hightower has worn every hat possible throughout his career in tech, and enjoys leadership roles focused on making things happen and shipping software.

Here is a short abstract from his talk: \"Okay, you've made the move to containers and can now write Dockerfiles for everything. How do you manage all of those containers?. Have you found that you traded managing individual machines for managing individual containers? Kubernetes, an Open Source container orchestration engine, can be your answer. We'll explore Kubernetes and see how you can use it to run massive collections of containers that fix their own problems and allow you to move your setup wherever you need to be.\"</p> <p>For this meeting, Signavio will be hosting us in their Lounge near the Tiergarten at Kurfürstenstr. 110 and will provide drinks and snacks.

Their visit follows the Firebase Summit in Prague.</p> <p>We will start at 18:30 with a presentation on Cloud Firestore. Following that presentation, a Firestore web codelab in an instructor-led format will take place. You will be able to run the codelab on your laptop, or just watch as it is being done by the Firebase developer. We will then have time for question, and networking.</p> <p>Here are the Firebase team members we are excited to have at this event:<br/>- Sam Stern writes open source samples and libraries (like FirebaseUI) to make Firebase development easier. He works on a lot of areas, but focuses on backend services (Firestore, RTDB, Functions, etc.). And he’s the team's designated Android nerd.<br/>- Tina Skublics is a software engineer on the Firebase console backend, which focuses on provisioning and managing resources for Firebase projects. Her work includes integrations such as Crashlytics BigQuery export, as well as support for selecting Cloud resource locations.<br/>- Rachel Saunders is a technical writer for Firebase.
