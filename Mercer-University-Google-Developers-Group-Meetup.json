Thanks! If any other members would like to present topics at a GDG meeting, we can make that happen.</p> <p>Kubernetes is the most popular container orchestration system and it was designed specifically with Google Cloud Platform integration in mind. We will begin with an overview of Kubernetes and how to use Google's QwikLabs. We will then provide free credits to Google's QwikLabs and get you started working through the following two labs:</p> <p>1. Introduction to Docker<br/>In this lab you will familiarize yourself with the basic Docker container environment commands. You will create, run, and debug containers, and learn to pull and push images to and from Google Container Registry.</p> <p>2. Hello Node Kubernetes<br/>In this hands-on lab, you turn your code into a replicated application running on Kubernetes. You create a Node.js app, create a Docker container from it, deploy it to Kubernetes Engine, and scale it up. Watch a short preview Hello Node Kubernetes, GCP Essentials.</p> ","visibility":"public"}]
