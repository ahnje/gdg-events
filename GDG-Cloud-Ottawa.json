With a host of APIs, GCP has a tool for just about any machine learning job. In this intermediate-level presentation, we will experiment machine learning APIs such as:</p> <p>- AI Chatbot with Dialogflow;<br/>- Cloud Vision API to detect labels, faces, and landmarks in images;<br/>- Cloud Vision, Natural Language, and Translation APIs to capture text strings from images, recognize characters, and analyze and translate the text strings into other languages;<br/>- Natural Language API to classify text into categories, extract entities, and perform sentiment and syntactic analysis on a block of text;<br/>- AutoML Vision to train a custom model to recognize different types of clouds (cumulus, cumulonimbus, etc.);<br/>- Cloud ML Engine to train, hyperparameter train and deploy a TensorFlow model for serving purposes.</p> <p>Short Bio: Carlos Timoteo is a Data Scientist at Pythian, with emphasis on Machine Learning Engineering to deploy scalable data solutions on the cloud. He also \"loves his data\" and holds MSc in Computer Engineer.</p> <p>Talk #3 Google Cloud Storage &amp; Databases<br/>Length: 40 mins</p> <p>Short Bio: Stephane Frechette is Google Cloud Solution Architect @ Pythian. His passions are Databases, Data Engineering, Data Science, Analytics, drums, good food and fine wine.</p> <p>Description: Coming soon!</p> ","visibility":"public"}]
