With a host of APIs, GCP has a tool for just about any machine learning job. In this intermediate-level presentation, we will experiment machine learning APIs such as:</p> <p>- AI Chatbot with Dialogflow;<br/>- Cloud Vision API to detect labels, faces, and landmarks in images;<br/>- Cloud Vision, Natural Language, and Translation APIs to capture text strings from images, recognize characters, and analyze and translate the text strings into other languages;<br/>- Natural Language API to classify text into categories, extract entities, and perform sentiment and syntactic analysis on a block of text;<br/>- AutoML Vision to train a custom model to recognize different types of clouds (cumulus, cumulonimbus, etc.);<br/>- Cloud ML Engine to train, hyperparameter train and deploy a TensorFlow model for serving purposes.</p> <p>Short Bio: Carlos Timoteo is a Data Scientist at Pythian, with emphasis on Machine Learning Engineering to deploy scalable data solutions on the cloud. He also \"loves his data\" and holds MSc in Computer Engineer.</p> <p>Talk #3 Google Cloud Storage &amp; Databases<br/>Length: 40 mins</p> <p>Short Bio: Stephane Frechette is Google Cloud Solution Architect @ Pythian.

Kubeflow Pipelines is part of the Kubeflow platform that enables composition and execution of reproducible workflows on Kubeflow, including TFX pipeline. A TFX pipeline is a sequence of components that implement an ML pipeline which is specifically designed for scalable, high-performance machine learning tasks. That includes modeling, training, serving inference, and managing deployments to online, native mobile, and JavaScript targets. On this presentation, we gonna learn how to do compute intensive model training (GPUs) on AI Platform using TFX.</p> <p>Carlos Timoteo is ML Engineer @Pythian and GDE in Machine Learning.</p> <p>=== Networking ===<br/>Final<br/>=== Closing ===<br/>Closing around 7h30pm.</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1586221277000,"duration":5400000,"id":"269902029","name":"GDG Cloud Ottawa June Online","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"upcoming","time":1592344800000,"local_date":"2020-06-16","local_time":"18:00","updated":1586221277000,"utc_offset":-14400000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":7,"venue":{"id":26906060,"name":"Online event","repinned":false,"country":"","localized_country_name":""},"is_online_event":true,"group":{"created":1525705509000,"name":"GDG Cloud - Ottawa","id":28413146,"join_mode":"open","lat":45.45000076293945,"lon":-75.69000244140625,"urlname":"GDG-Cloud-Ottawa","who":"Members","localized_location":"Ottawa, ON","state":"ON","country":"ca","region":"en_US","timezone":"Canada/Eastern"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Cloud-Ottawa/events/269902029/","description":"<p>=== Online Event Starts @ 6:00 ===</p> <p>Join our Slack group: <a href=\"https://communityinviter.com/apps/gdgottawa/join-gdg-ottawa-community\" class=\"linkified\">https://communityinviter.com/apps/gdgottawa/join-gdg-ottawa-community</a></p> <p>=== Networking ===<br/>=== Small intro ===<br/>General information.<br/>=== Talk 1 ===</p> <p>TBD.</p> <p>=== Talk 2 ===</p> <p>TBD.</p> <p>=== Networking ===<br/>=== Closing ===</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false}],"organizers":[{"id":19578651,"name":"Carlos T.","status":"active","joined":1310100567000,"city":"Ottawa","country":"ca","localized_country_name":"Canada","state":"ON","lat":45.41,"lon":-75.69,"photo":{"id":18002591,"photo_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/1/f/member_18002591.jpeg","thumb_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/1/f/thumb_18002591.jpeg","type":"member","base_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com"},"group_profile":{"status":"active","visited":1590175403000,"created":1527026248000,"updated":1566845721000,"role":"coorganizer","group":{"id":28413146,"urlname":"GDG-Cloud-Ottawa","name":"GDG Cloud - Ottawa","status":"active","who":"Members","members":319,"join_mode":"open","localized_location":"Ottawa, ON"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Cloud-Ottawa/members/19578651/"},"is_pro_admin":false},{"id":39426932,"name":"St√©phane F.","bio":"Cloud Solution Architect | Databases | Data Engineering | Data Science | Analytics.
