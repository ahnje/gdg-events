With a host of APIs, GCP has a tool for just about any machine learning job. In this intermediate-level presentation, we will experiment machine learning APIs such as:</p> <p>- AI Chatbot with Dialogflow;<br/>- Cloud Vision API to detect labels, faces, and landmarks in images;<br/>- Cloud Vision, Natural Language, and Translation APIs to capture text strings from images, recognize characters, and analyze and translate the text strings into other languages;<br/>- Natural Language API to classify text into categories, extract entities, and perform sentiment and syntactic analysis on a block of text;<br/>- AutoML Vision to train a custom model to recognize different types of clouds (cumulus, cumulonimbus, etc.);<br/>- Cloud ML Engine to train, hyperparameter train and deploy a TensorFlow model for serving purposes.</p> <p>Short Bio: Carlos Timoteo is a Data Scientist at Pythian, with emphasis on Machine Learning Engineering to deploy scalable data solutions on the cloud. He also \"loves his data\" and holds MSc in Computer Engineer.</p> <p>Talk #3 Google Cloud Storage &amp; Databases<br/>Length: 40 mins</p> <p>Short Bio: Stephane Frechette is Google Cloud Solution Architect @ Pythian. His passions are Databases, Data Engineering, Data Science, Analytics, drums, good food and fine wine.</p> <p>Description: Coming soon!</p> ","visibility":"public"}],"organizers":[{"id":183625755,"name":"Archy (aka Ayrat K.","bio":"Cloud Native Ambassador (CNCF) and Cloud Architect at CloudOps\nHelping companies own their destiny in the Cloud.","status":"active","joined":1421406636000,"city":"Montr√©al","country":"ca","localized_country_name":"Canada","state":"QC","lat":45.5,"lon":-73.55,"photo":{"id":253591608,"highres_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/7/b/7/8/highres_253591608.jpeg","photo_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/7/b/7/8/member_253591608.jpeg","thumb_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/7/b/7/8/thumb_253591608.jpeg","type":"member","base_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com"},"group_profile":{"status":"active","visited":1554410555000,"created":1528238965000,"updated":1529877223000,"role":"coorganizer","group":{"id":28413146,"urlname":"GDG-Cloud-Ottawa","name":"GDG Cloud - Ottawa","status":"active","who":"Members","members":198,"join_mode":"open","localized_location":"Ottawa, ON"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Cloud-Ottawa/members/183625755/"},"is_pro_admin":false},{"id":194434399,"name":"Jonathan P.","bio":"Security @Shopify ‚òÅÔ∏è\nCKA #89 ‚éà\nGCIA, GSEC üîí\nRetired SIGINT cyber sailor ‚öì","status":"active","joined":1445453873000,"city":"Ottawa","country":"ca","localized_country_name":"Canada","state":"ON","lat":45.42,"lon":-75.68,"photo":{"id":275769048,"highres_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/2/3/5/8/highres_275769048.jpeg","photo_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/2/3/5/8/member_275769048.jpeg","thumb_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/2/3/5/8/thumb_275769048.jpeg","type":"member","base_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com"},"group_profile":{"status":"active","visited":1553636601000,"created":1526412669000,"updated":1527026197000,"role":"organizer","group":{"id":28413146,"urlname":"GDG-Cloud-Ottawa","name":"GDG Cloud - Ottawa","status":"active","who":"Members","members":198,"join_mode":"open","localized_location":"Ottawa, ON"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Cloud-Ottawa/members/194434399/"},"is_pro_admin":false},{"id":253980805,"name":"Tatiana A.","status":"active","joined":1525703897000,"city":"Montr√©al","country":"ca","localized_country_name":"Canada","state":"QC","lat":45.65,"lon":-73.5,"photo":{"id":277006559,"highres_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/b/5/d/f/highres_277006559.jpeg","photo_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/b/5/d/f/member_277006559.jpeg","thumb_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/b/5/d/f/thumb_277006559.jpeg","type":"member","base_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com"},"group_profile":{"status":"active","visited":1549999658000,"created":1525706886000,"updated":1525964128000,"role":"coorganizer","group":{"id":28413146,"urlname":"GDG-Cloud-Ottawa","name":"GDG Cloud - Ottawa","status":"active","who":"Members","members":198,"join_mode":"open","localized_location":"Ottawa, ON"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Cloud-Ottawa/members/253980805/"},"is_pro_admin":false},{"id":19578651,"name":"Carlos T.","status":"active","joined":1310100567000,"city":"Ottawa","country":"ca","localized_country_name":"Canada","state":"ON","lat":45.41,"lon":-75.69,"photo":{"id":18002591,"photo_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/1/f/member_18002591.jpeg","thumb_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/1/f/thumb_18002591.jpeg","type":"member","base_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com"},"group_profile":{"status":"active","visited":1553638835000,"created":1527026248000,"updated":1552961135000,"role":"assistant_organizer","group":{"id":28413146,"urlname":"GDG-Cloud-Ottawa","name":"GDG Cloud - Ottawa","status":"active","who":"Members","members":198,"join_mode":"open","localized_location":"Ottawa, ON"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Cloud-Ottawa/members/19578651/"},"is_pro_admin":false}]}
