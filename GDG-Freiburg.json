Die quelloffene Sprache wurde von den Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike und Ken Thompson erfunden und hat eine sehr aktive Community. Golang hat eine mit C vergleichbare Laufzeitperformance bietet aber gleichzeitig ein automatisches Memory-Management an. Concurrency ist als First-Class-Citizen in Form von Goroutines und Channels direkt in die Sprache eingebettet. Darüber hinaus werden Tools wie Code-Formating, Test-Runner, Benchmarking, Code-Coverage oder Profiling direkt mit geliefert. Trotz der vielen Vorteile, die Go bietet gibt es in Deutschland verhältnismäßig wenige Entwickler, die sich selber als „Gopher“ bezeichnen.</p> <p>Wir wollen euch mit dem Golang Meetup die Sprache näher bringen und bei Interesse eine aktive Go-Community im Breisgau ins Leben rufen. Als Starthilfe haben wir uns einen Go-Experten aus München eingeladen.</p> <p><b>Speaker:<br/></b>Oliver Eilhard - „Oliver is a passionate programmer who fell in love with Go when it was released in 2012. Since then, he brought several Go-based applications into production. As an avid fan of Open Source, he maintains Elastic, the most commonly used Go client for Elasticsearch. In this meetup, he will talk about various topics he learned on his journey of working with Go professionally.“</p> <p>&lt;a&gt;<a href=\"https://www.xing.com/profile/Oliver_Eilhard&lt;/a&gt\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.xing.com/profile/Oliver_Eilhard&lt;/a&gt</a>;<br/>&lt;a&gt;<a href=\"https://github.com/olivere&lt;/a&gt\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/olivere&lt;/a&gt</a>;</p> <p><b>Host: </b><br/>iTernity GmbH <br/><a href=\"http://www.iternity.com/\">www.iTernity.com</a></p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1474271337000,"duration":7200000,"id":"mnmbzlywhbjb","name":"Creating Apps using Firebase","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1498291200000,"local_date":"2017-06-24","local_time":"10:00","updated":1498301869000,"utc_offset":7200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":10,"venue":{"id":25312305,"name":"Jedox AG","lat":47.99793243408203,"lon":7.842320919036865,"repinned":false,"address_1":"Bismarckallee 9, 4th floor","city":"Freiburg","country":"de","localized_country_name":"Germany"},"group":{"created":1467030440000,"name":"GDG Freiburg","id":20119936,"join_mode":"open","lat":47.9900016784668,"lon":7.849999904632568,"urlname":"GDG-Freiburg","who":"Google Developers","localized_location":"Freiburg, Germany","state":"","country":"de","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Berlin"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Freiburg/events/mnmbzlywhbjb/","manual_attendance_count":4,"description":"<p>Topic: Demonstration of Firebase features - Auth, Realtime Database, Firebase Storage and Functions</p> <p>We will demonstrate the features using an example showcase app.</p> <p>In this meetup, we will show how easy it is to program an app using Firebase.
