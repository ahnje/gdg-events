GDG Düsseldorf member Phillip, with plenty of experience with Scrum will be holding a talk about how to use Scrum without losing ourselves - a much needed talk in times where being “agile” is sometimes used as an excuse for not needing a plan. Looking forward to learn more! This is a talk that makes sense to anyone involved in especially software development projects, whether it's front end or back end, web or mobile, corporate or freelance. </p> <p>The second talk will be  <b>Game Development for Android and Cast with Unity</b>. Abdülhamit, another of our GDG Düsseldorf members, is a professional Unity Developer and he will be holding this talk, showing us how to integrate Google Cast into a game. </p> <p>Come and join us for an interesting evening of tech talks, networking, learning and general fun. </p> <p>As so often before the event will take place at the coworking space Garage Bilk, something we can thank our sponsor SCARATEC for. </p> <p>Hope to see you at yet another interesting evening together with our great community.</p> <p>The biggest thank you goes to the community, it is the community that makes GDG Düsseldorf and Women Techmakers great and we are depending on you! </p> <p>If you are interested in contributing to our community by holding a talk yourself, contact one of the organisers - we are always open for new ideas and suggestions; And a talk can be a long talk or a short talk, a blitz talk for 5 minutes or even a workshop - tell us what you want to do and we'll try and find the fitting format.</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1460443771000,"id":"230311262","name":"Google I/O Extended with GDG Düsseldorf - signup via Meetup GDG Dus","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1463590800000,"local_date":"2016-05-18","local_time":"19:00","updated":1463603337000,"utc_offset":7200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":1,"group":{"created":1425639041000,"name":"Women Techmakers Düsseldorf","id":18481463,"join_mode":"open","lat":51.2400016784668,"lon":6.789999961853027,"urlname":"Women-Techmakers-Dusseldorf","who":"Techmakers","localized_location":"Düsseldorf, Germany","state":"","country":"de","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Berlin"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/Women-Techmakers-Dusseldorf/events/230311262/","description":"<p>Come and join us for our Google I/O extended on the first day of Google I/O, May 18 (the whole conference runs May 18-20, but the I/O Extended event is limited to one evening).</p> <p>We do the Google I/O Extended as part of GDG Düsseldorf - sign up via the <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Google-Developer-Group-Dusseldorf/events/230270018/\">GDG Dus Meetup page</a></p> <p>We'll gather, mingle, talk about tech, watch the Google I/O keynotes, and network.</p> <p>Notice!

As designers and developers we need to understand the latest and the greatest - and Christopher will give us our first introduction.</p> <p>Pascal Welsch needs no further introduction, an experienced Android developer who is a long time member of GDG and have presented many interesting topics - now Pascal is back.</p> <p>We will be learning more about Edystone beacons, the nearby API (Trello uses this, for example) and lots more.

We are a part of GDG, Google Developer Group, an independent network of techies and developers. </p> <p>WTM is for <b>women in tech</b>, or with <i>an interest in tech</i> - tech and being a woman in tech is our focus.</p> <p><i>This event </i>is for women and those who don't identify as men. (Kids are of course welcome with their parents but there is no baby sitting service - this is just a casual get-together)</p> <p>Bigger WTM events and tech talks are open to women and those who support us regardless of gender but during this brunch we want to take the opportunity to network and talk about how to build a stronger WTM network lifting up the female voices. We also want to keep it relatively small this time, hence this time we are for those who identify themselves as women or non-male only. </p> <p>In Düsseldorf we have previously made a big effort to increase female attendance and talk about diversity at other events, especially the GDG events, but now it is time we get together on our own. </p> <p>Notice! WTM events are an <i>add-on</i> to other tech events, you are very much encouraged to attend GDG events as well as other events - WTM will never replace those events and for Düsseldorf the concept with WTM will be different than with GDG; there is no point in copying a good concept, when we can have both!</p> <p>So come and join for our first WTM Düsseldorf stand-alone get-together. </p> <p>We will meet at <a href=\"https://www.deine-brasserie.de/\">Brasserie Düsseldorf</a>, on Kasernenstrasse 44 - that is down by Graf Adolf Plats, at the ground floor of the high building often referred to as \"GAP15\"</p> <p><b>Looking forward to seeing you there!</b></p> <p><i>Notice!
