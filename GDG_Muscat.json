بتطوير المجتمع من خلال بناء فكر الفرد. نهدف إلى إنشاء منصة لإلهام الإبتكار والإبداع، حيث ننشر المعرفة من منطلق إيماننا بأن المجتمعات تنهض من خلال الرواد. أقيم أول مؤتمر لسال عام ٢٠١٦ تحت شعار \"شغف بلا حدود\" تلاه \"أقدر\" عام ٢٠١٧ بحضور تجاوز ال٢٠٠ شخص وتفاعل يفوق المليون ونصف شخص عبر منصات التواصل الإجتماعي.</p> <p>شعار هذا العام \"الفن الرقمي في الأماكن العامة\" :</p> <p>حيث تعرف صلاله بمدينة الفنون والذي تشكل نسيج حياتها وتمازج القاطنين فيها، لكن هل تحكي المدينة قصة فنونها؟ هل نرى الفن في أبنيتها وشوارعها وطرقها وأماكنها السياحيه العديدة، وبتنقل العالم الآن الى الفن الرقمي وهو ببساطة استخدام التكنولوجيا لنتاج فني قد يكون بسيطا كصوره أو موسيقى، أو يتدرج ليصبح اكثر تعقيدا كالجرافيك واستخدام برمجيات وخوارزميات لإنتاج مايسمى بالفن الرقمي.</p> <p>يناقش مؤتمر هذا العام وجود الفن في حياتنا وفي الحياه التي نعيشها، هل يعطينا بُعداً آخر لتمتزج وتغير من اسلوب حياة المجتمع؟ وبما ان نطاق الاماكن العامه توسع ليشمل الاماكن العامه الرقميه كمنصات التواصل الإجتماعي ميديا فإننا سنتطرق ايضا لها.</p> <p>تم التعاون بين سال ومجموعة مطوري جوجل بمسقط، لعمل مجموعة ورشات تقنية وتعليمية من قبل خبراء جوجل للتطوير وخبراء محليين. سيتم الإعلان عن جدول الفعالية قريبا، كونوا بالإنتظار.</p>
