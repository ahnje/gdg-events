The key requirements such security, traffic control, resiliency, monitoring, metrics, and logging often becomes quite difficult in a microservice architecture. More complex requirements, such as A/B testing, canary releases, rate limiting, policy enforcement, access control, and end-to-end authentication become an even larger burden.  </p> <p>Enter Istio. Istio is a new open source project launched by IBM, Google and Lyft, designed to connect, manage, and secure micro services. Istio solves many of these complex requirements, with the added bonus of not requiring a change to the application code. We will be going over what you can do with Istio and showing some demos of it in action on a kubernetes cluster. </p> <p>Food and drinks will be provided. </p> ","how_to_find_us":"Screen shot attached","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1506986279000,"id":"243868434","name":"Monitoring your GCP applications with Stackdriver","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1507680000000,"local_date":"2017-10-10","local_time":"19:00","updated":1513744085000,"utc_offset":-18000000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":66,"venue":{"id":25527551,"name":"Google","lat":30.265932083129883,"lon":-97.74910736083984,"repinned":false,"address_1":"500 West 2nd Street","city":"Austin","country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA"},"group":{"created":1447280972000,"name":"GDG Cloud Austin","id":19112928,"join_mode":"open","lat":30.270000457763672,"lon":-97.73999786376953,"urlname":"GDG-Cloud-Austin","who":"GCP Gurus","localized_location":"Austin, TX","state":"TX","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Central"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Cloud-Austin/events/243868434/","manual_attendance_count":45,"description":"<p>This month Amir Hermelin, GCP Product Manager, will talk about Stackdriver, how to use it to monitor your GCP (and AWS) applications, and what Stackdriver's future road map looks like.</p> <p>In addition, Cher Simon, SRE Manager at The Home Depot, will talk about how The Home Depot used BigQuery to build an SLO framework for every microservice it deployed, called VALET (Volume, Availability, Latency, Errors, and Tickets).</p> <p>Come join us at Google's new downtown office.

Brandon B. Jozsa, Senior Solutions Architect at Tigera, will be presenting a talk on Kubernetes deployment tool Helm 3.</p> <p>Brandon has worked for large companies that include AT&amp;T, Charter, and Red Hat. While at AT&amp;T, Brandon championed the notion that AIC should migrate all of its core services to Kubernetes using Helm. This led to the introduction of the OpenStack-Helm project, and thus the Airship and Akraino projects were later conceived. At Charter, Brandon was the Principal Architect and core development lead for the SE Cloud Infrastructure team. Brandon loves hacking on all things Linux, Security, and cloud, but in his spare time he enjoys spending time with his wife Rachel and their two dogs Juno and Ajax.</p> <p>Title: Smoother Sailing and Scaling with Helm Version 3<br/>Abstract: What’s all this buzz about Helm v3 you ask? Helm users have been asking for changes, and the development team has answered by rearchitecting Helm in version 3. This technical session will cover a wide range of improvements to Helm that address operability, scalability, and security concerns that users had with prior versions of Helm. During the session we’ll help users create a library that will improve scalability, security, and overall workflow complete with example code.</p> <p>Food and drinks will be sponsored by Tigera.</p> <p>Looking forward to see you there.</p> <p>Location:<br/>Volusion, LLC<br/>1835A Kramer Lane Suite 100, Austin, TX</p> <p><a href=\"https://maps.google.com/maps?q=1835%20Kramer%20Lane%2C%20Austin%2C%20TX\" class=\"linkified\">https://maps.google.com/maps?q=1835%20Kramer%20Lane%2C%20Austin%2C%20TX</a></p> ","how_to_find_us":"We're at the corner or Kramer Ln and Boyer Ln.","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1568739244000,"duration":5400000,"id":"264928707","name":"GCP for Startups & Introduction to GCP Fundamentals","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1571873400000,"local_date":"2019-10-23","local_time":"18:30","updated":1571887302000,"utc_offset":-18000000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":110,"venue":{"id":26164078,"name":"Google Austin","lat":30.266035079956055,"lon":-97.74923706054688,"repinned":true,"address_1":"500 W 2nd St","city":"Austin","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"78701","state":"TX"},"group":{"created":1447280972000,"name":"GDG Cloud Austin","id":19112928,"join_mode":"open","lat":30.270000457763672,"lon":-97.73999786376953,"urlname":"GDG-Cloud-Austin","who":"GCP Gurus","localized_location":"Austin, TX","state":"TX","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Central"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Cloud-Austin/events/264928707/","description":"<p>We have two great topics for the October Meetup:</p> <p>## GCP for Startups Program<br/>Eugene Yi from the GCP for Startups Team is going to talk about Google's program to help startups: what benefits you get as a startup company, how to qualify, and more.
