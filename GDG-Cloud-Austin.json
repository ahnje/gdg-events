The key requirements such security, traffic control, resiliency, monitoring, metrics, and logging often becomes quite difficult in a microservice architecture. More complex requirements, such as A/B testing, canary releases, rate limiting, policy enforcement, access control, and end-to-end authentication become an even larger burden.  </p> <p>Enter Istio.

In independent tests conducted by Stanford University, the ResNet-50 model trained on a TPU was the fastest (30 minutes) to reach the desired accuracy on the ImageNet dataset. In this talk, she'll walk you through why you would use TPUs and an overview of the hardware. She will also show examples of state-of-the-art models for valuable use cases and provide details of how you could adapt your own model for TPU training.</p> <p>Google is paying for pizza and drinks.
