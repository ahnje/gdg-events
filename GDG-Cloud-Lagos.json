Do you love to communicate complex topics in an understandable straightforward way? Are you interested in contributing to one of the most popular open-source machine learning frameworks? Look no further!<br/>Documentation is a developer's first impression of any open-source project, and one of the most important pieces of any software application.<br/>One of the primary focus areas of TensorFlow 2.0 is documentation, and the team are firmly committed to improving it for the latest iteration of the API.</p> <p>In this 3-hour workshop, you will learn how to document an API symbol, and how to make your first pull request to the TensorFlow repo.</p> <p>Beginners are very welcome: new to TensorFlow, or new to open-source.<br/>It will be great to have knowledge of Python and Machine Learning.</p> <p>RSVP now if you'll be happy to be a part of the small hands making TensorFlow better!</p> <p>ONLY ~30 seats available.</p> <p>Requirements: Please bring a fully charged
