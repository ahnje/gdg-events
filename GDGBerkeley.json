The demo uses an orchestrated set of smartphones to capture multi-angle views of the same event, upload them to the cloud and have them stitched together in real time to create a  single 180-degree snapshot of that moment. </p> <p><i><b>Demo</b></i>: They will have a live demo setup that folks can stop by and participate in!</p> <p><b>BigQuery Workshop: </b>Data is great, but insights are better. Learn how you can use BigQuery to analyze terabytes of data in seconds using SQL, without ever setting up a cluster or learning a complicated new syntax. Sandeep and Mark will give an overview of BigQuery and the motivations behind data processing at Google, and then you can get your hands dirty writing your own queries!</p> <p><b><br/></b></p> <p><b>Speaker Profiles</b></p> <p><b>Sandeep</b> started coding and creating websites when he was 12 and hasn't stopped. He is passionate about building easy-to-use products people love. Before Google, he founded an IoT startup in agriculture and developed educational HTML5 games. At Google, Sandeep's goal is to make cloud easy and help developers create the next big thing. Sandeep loves video games, making music, and martial arts, and has Bachelors in Marketing and Computer Science.</p> <p><b>Mark Mandel </b>is a Developer Advocate for the Google Cloud Platform. Hailing from Australia, Mark built his career developing backend web applications which included several widely adopted open source projects, and running an international conference in Melbourne for several years. Since then he has focused on becoming a polyglot developer, building systems in Go, JRuby and Clojure on a variety of infrastructures. In his spare time he plays with his dog, trains martial arts and reads too much fantasy literature.</p> <p>For more information.</p> <p>DevFest: <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/events/devfest/\"><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/events/devfest/\" class=\"linkified\">https://developers.google.com/events/devfest/</a></a></p> <p>CloudSpin: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/googlecloudspin\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/googlecloudspin\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/googlecloudspin</a></a></p> <p>Google Big Query: <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/what-is-bigquery\"><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/what-is-bigquery\" class=\"linkified\">https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/what-is-bigquery</a></a></p> <p>We are dedicated to creating welcoming and friendly learning environments. <a href=\"http://bridgefoundry.org/code-of-conduct/\" class=\"linkified\">http://bridgefoundry.org/code-of-conduct/</a></p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1448046131000,"id":"226912963","name":"CodeGirl screening","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1449109800000,"local_date":"2015-12-02","local_time":"18:30","updated":1449121617000,"utc_offset":-28800000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":13,"venue":{"id":22407432,"name":"Next Space Berkeley","lat":37.8702507019043,"lon":-122.26881408691406,"repinned":false,"address_1":"2081 Center St","city":"Berkeley","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"","state":"CA"},"group":{"created":1406584074000,"name":"GDG Berkeley","id":16038482,"join_mode":"open","lat":37.869998931884766,"lon":-122.26000213623047,"urlname":"GDGBerkeley","who":"GDevs","localized_location":"Berkeley, CA","state":"CA","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Pacific"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDGBerkeley/events/226912963/","description":"<p><a href=\"http://www.codegirlmovie.com/\"><a href=\"http://www.codegirlmovie.com/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.codegirlmovie.com/</a></a></p> <p>Join high school-aged girls from around the world as they try to better their community through technology and collaboration in this thrilling, heartfelt documentary.</p> <p>By 2017, the app market will be valued at $77 Billion.

You have to deal with all the hard problems: device network performance, real-time bidirectional communication, scalable infrastructures and distributed system complexity. By leveraging some popular open source libraries such as Docker, Kubernetes and gRPC, we are able to mitigate many of these issues to quickly build a scalable, real-time experience that can be accessed around the world by millions of people. During this talk, we will look at how gRPC can be used as a performant real-time communication framework that works across platforms such as wearables and embedded devices as well as languages, such as Go, Node.js and Java. We will also combine this with Kubernetes’ powerful ability to orchestrate containers at scale, handling and coordinating large amounts of traffic from all these devices.</p> <p><b>Bio: </b></p> <p>Sandeep started coding and creating websites when he was 12 and hasn't stopped.

creation) taking place around the world at physical locations. Think of it as a hackathon focused on game development. It is the growth of an idea that in today’s heavily connected world, we could come together, be creative, share experiences and express ourselves in a multitude of ways using video games – it is very universal. The weekend stirs a global creative buzz in games, while at the same time exploring the process of development, be it programming, iterative design, narrative exploration or artistic expression. It is all condensed into a 48 hour development cycle. The GGJ encourages people with all kinds of backgrounds to participate and contribute to this global spread of game development and creativity.</p> <p>The structure of a jam is usually that everyone gathers on Friday late afternoon, watches a short video keynote with advice from leading game developers, and then a secret theme is announced. All sites worldwide are then challenged to make games based on that same theme, with games to be completed by Sunday afternoon. In January 2016, we had over 600 locations in 93 countries create 6866 games in one weekend! GGJ 2017 is January 20-22 at a location near you… if not you can make one of your own. The jam is known for helping foster new friendships, increase confidence and opportunities within the community. The jam is always an intellectual challenge. People are invited to explore new technology tools, trying on new roles in development and testing their skills to do something that requires them to design, develop create, test and make a new game in the time span of 48 hours.</p> <p>The GGJ stimulates collaboration and is not a competition.</p> <p><a href=\"http://globalgamejam.org/2017/jam-sites/google-cloud-playcrafting-ggj-launchpad-sf\">Register on the site's event</a>.</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1485992932000,"duration":10800000,"id":"237382148","name":"TensorFlow Keynote Streaming","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1487385000000,"local_date":"2017-02-17","local_time":"18:30","rsvp_close_offset":"PT5H30M","updated":1487432512000,"utc_offset":-28800000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":39,"group":{"created":1406584074000,"name":"GDG Berkeley","id":16038482,"join_mode":"open","lat":37.869998931884766,"lon":-122.26000213623047,"urlname":"GDGBerkeley","who":"GDevs","localized_location":"Berkeley, CA","state":"CA","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Pacific"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDGBerkeley/events/237382148/","description":"<p><b>TensorFlow</b> is an open source software library for machine learning in various kinds of perceptual and language understanding tasks.</p> <p>Come learn the latest news from the team, meet other Machine Learning and AI enthusiasts, and get resources and advice for further learning.</p> <p>Snacks and drinks will be served!</p> <p><b>Schedule</b></p> <p>6:30-7 arrive &amp; mingle</p> <p>7 - 9 Viewing Party </p> <p>9-9:30 Well wishes &amp; clean up</p> <p>Co-Organized by <a href=\"https://techqueria.org\">Techqueria</a>, <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-East-Bay/\">Women Who Code East Bay</a>, and <a href=\"http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2FAccel.ai%2F&amp;h=ATOyZ435_45TH5uZK6WoQaLF-RwrBQV8LX7FYWsZ-YU4ww2RSNsHcV8JjthNkUuLE5BTrUrXTaPQjsqhJ-aaklrt50foY6YMKiap58rqT3dpdTfW9Dk4_y1QiF3vXRvMYoN4iP6eqGU\">Accel.ai</a>.</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1485151774000,"id":"237129658","name":"International Women's Day 2017 - Mountain View","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1488690000000,"local_date":"2017-03-04","local_time":"21:00","updated":1488701737000,"utc_offset":-28800000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":14,"venue":{"id":23752270,"name":"Google Hq","lat":37.42278289794922,"lon":-122.08509826660156,"repinned":false,"address_1":"Amphitheatre Pkwy 1600","city":"Mountain View","country":"BR","localized_country_name":"Brazil"},"group":{"created":1406584074000,"name":"GDG Berkeley","id":16038482,"join_mode":"open","lat":37.869998931884766,"lon":-122.26000213623047,"urlname":"GDGBerkeley","who":"GDevs","localized_location":"Berkeley, CA","state":"CA","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Pacific"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDGBerkeley/events/237129658/","description":"<p>The Women Techmakers Global Event Series Celebrating International Women's Day.</p> <p><b>Why are we doing this?</b></p> <p>Google strives to cultivate a wholly inclusive workplace around the globe.
