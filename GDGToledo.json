So you, as a full-stack web developer, turn it into a HTML form with an AJAX POST to save the data to a database table in the standard CRUD model. It works well enough, but then the users said, \"we really need simultaneous editing for everyone in the office.\" Now you're in trouble because you're trying to reinvent Google Docs / Sheets, which are very complex. How do those collaborative editing tools really work? </p> <p>We will look at the Google Realtime API, which uses Operational Transformation to automatically synchronize a document between multiple simultaneous editors. Everything you know about distributed version control systems applies to this situation, but now you need to make it work seamlessly for users who have never heard of \"git rebase\". The client and server implementation of Operational Transformation is very challenging.</p> <p>Alternatives to Operational Transformation (OT) include Differential Synchronization (DS, aka. 3-way merge), Conflict-free Replicated Data Type (CRDT), and plain old Last Write Wins (LWW). For any of these methods, the critical elements include websockets, message queues, and persistent data storage. This presentation will include a demonstration of a simple implementation of collaborative editing with free, locally hosted software only.</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1512070197000,"duration":9000000,"id":"245536073","name":"Tech Toledo's Holiday Mixer 2017","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1512685800000,"local_date":"2017-12-07","local_time":"17:30","updated":1512698262000,"utc_offset":-18000000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":8,"venue":{"id":25548006,"name":"Renaissance Toledo Downtown Hotel","lat":41.65250778198242,"lon":-83.53150177001953,"repinned":false,"address_1":"444 North Summit Street","city":"Toledo","country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA"},"group":{"created":1449710043000,"name":"Google Developer Group Toledo","id":19198823,"join_mode":"open","lat":41.66999816894531,"lon":-83.5999984741211,"urlname":"GDGToledo","who":"GDG'ers","localized_location":"Toledo, OH","state":"OH","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Eastern"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDGToledo/events/245536073/","description":"<p>• What we'll do</p> <p>It appears as tickets have more sold out. But everyone is welcome to join at 8 pm upstairs on the roof (The Heights) for the social gathering and drinks (bring your money and possibly your Lyft app if you will be drinking a lot!)</p> <p>Tech Toledo invites all information technology professionals to join us on Thursday December 7th for our 7th Annual Holiday Mixer. The Mixer is our end-of-the-year community party and a celebration of the various IT-related groups (meetups, professionals associations, user groups). We also welcome non-IT professionals, such as entrepreneurs, designers, business leaders, planners, engineers, government officials, and marketing professionals, to join us to meet members of the region's tech community. We are at the new Renaissance Toledo Downtown Hotel this year. The Mixer outgrew Packo's at the Park and the Blarney Event Center. Now we are at the newest hotel in downtown Toledo, with room for our largest crowd ever. The Mixer is free to attend, but individuals should register for a ticket here ahead of time. There will be a cash bar, as usual. New this year: we will be providing a light meal for attendees, thanks to our sponsors! Companies and organizations can sponsor the Mixer to support the community! Sponsors will be mentioned in promotional material before the event and on signage at the Mixer. Basic sponsorship is only $100. Advanced sponsorship is $200, for those organizations that want to give more. The $500 Premier sponsorship level includes a few minutes of speaking time and a table to display information. Sponsors can pay here with a credit card by selecting one of the sponsor \"tickets.\" Or contact us via email ([masked]) to request an invoice. As in past years, community groups are invited to join us. Instead of having a separate \"holiday party\" for your group, have it with us! It is free for groups to join us. We just ask that the group leaders promote the Mixer, invite their members, and ask members to register here with us. In return, each group gets a table at the Mixer, where members can hang out and prospective members can learn more about the group. Complete the \"Community group\" ticket information to apply. See TechToledo.com for the current list of sponsors and community groups. After the Mixer, we encourage attendees who want to keep partying to join us at The Heights, the hotel's amazing rooftop bar. The Vistula Garage (across the street) provides convenient parking: take the underground concourse to the hotel. Tentative schedule 5:30pm: Doors open to the ballroom. If you show up early, you can hang out in the foyer or check out the hotel. 5:30pm - 6:30pm: Get some food and drink, visit sponsor tables, hang out with members of your group at their tables, or introduce yourself to someone new. 6:30pm - 7:15pm: Tech Toledo recap of what happened in 2017 and information about each community group. Brief sponsor presentations. 7:15pm - 8:00pm: Continue socializing, learning about the community groups, meeting sponsors, eating, drinking. 8:00pm: Event is over, head up to The Heights for more.</p> <p>• What to bring<br/>Members need to bring an appetite and the desire to mingle.
