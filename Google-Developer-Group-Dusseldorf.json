Generate revenues with your Android App on the BlackBerry 10 Platform, by Kamel Lajili (BlackBerry Deutschland GmbH)<br/>The BlackBerry 10 Platform included from the beginning an optimized Android runtime inside. This had some limitations so that only 60…70% of android apps were functional after conversion. Now with the upcoming release[masked] we improved that runtime considerably and we made it possible to simply tap apk files to get them installed on your BlackBerry 10 devices. No conversions are required any more.

Do you specifically have an interest in <b>Android</b>?</p> <p><i>Well, this might just be the perfect opportunity for you!</i></p> <p>The topic for this year’s <b>Study Jam season </b>is <b>Android for Beginners.</b></p> <p>What IS a Study Jam? <b>Study Jams</b> are <i>community driven events</i>, where we get together to learn. The great thing about Study Jams is that we can <i>support and inspire</i> each other - and, because it is an organised event, we also have a <b>facilitator</b> who will be able to assist when we get stuck. We will be using the <a href=\"https://www.udacity.com/course/android-development-for-beginners--ud837\">Udacity course Android for Beginners</a> for this Study Jam.</p> <p>You don’t need to know anything about Android programming to take this course, what</p> <p> you need is</p> <p>• An <b>interest to learn</b> </p> <p>• A <b>computer</b> (one that you have permissions to install on.)</p> <p>• A bit of free <b>time</b></p> <p>• Some <b>patience</b>. You will not become a software developer over one weekend - but it will get you started, if you have an interest, and patience.</p> <p>It is good if you have an Android phone, for testing, but it isn't a must.</p> <p>If you have programming experience from before - well, that doesn't hurt, but it is not necessary. You DO need an interest in technology though - and it is helpful if you have an<b> interest in problem solving</b>. </p> <p>This course is however aimed at those who either</p> <p><b>• Are new to programming </b>or </p> <p>• Have programming experience but<b> never used Android</b></p> <p>GDG:s <i>around the globe</i> are organising Study Jams this season. In Düsseldorf we have decided to run our Study Jam over a weekend, other groups may have a different setup - however we are all using the same course material. The course on Udacity assumes 6 hours of work per week for 4 weeks. This means you will not finish during the Study Jam, but you will get a very good start.</p> <p>After going through the course and finishing your project, within a set time - you have some time after the Study Jam weekend - you will even get a certificate, and Google offer a discount on their nano degrees. So not only do you have the opportunity to meet cool people, learn a new technology, challenge yourself, you actually have a chance to get something in the end as well. </p> <p>Some participants from the Study Jam sessions from around the globe will also be offered <b>opportunity to join Google Launchpad with completed app, pending app quality </b></p> <p>Who is this for? As mentioned above, this is for people who wants to learn to program for Android. You do NOT need previous Android experience.  You don't even need to have Android Studio installed before you arrive (but if you do, that doesn't hurt)</p> <p><b>Where? And how?<br/></b>Our sponsor, Scaratec, are kind enough to offer us to use their space. Notice! Space is limited, so signup is absolutely essential! </p> <p>We have an excellent and very experienced Android developer who will help us facilitate the event and guide us and help us if we get stuck - <b>Pascal Welsch</b>. We are very happy and excited to have Pascal, who is an engaged member of our community who held several talks and taught us about Android before, be our trainer for this course.</p> <p>Additionally we also have <b>Wolfram Rittmeyer</b> helping us out - if we can't make it with these two on our side, then I don't know how - Wolfram and Pascal are extremely professional, calm and very good at explaining. </p> <p>Thank you both for what you do for our community!</p> <p><b>What you need to prepare</b></p> <p>Check the <a href=\"https://www.udacity.com/tech-requirements\">Hardware requirements (follow the link)</a></p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.udacity.com/course/android-development-for-beginners--ud837\">course itself you will find here (follow the link)</a></p> <p>We will send out a link to all participants with the link to register on Udacity.</p> <p>Reserve<b> your spot NOW</b> - we offer this for <b>a limited number </b>of attendees, to allow every student to get enough attention and to make sure we have enough room for everyone.</p> <p>All reservations <b>via Meetup ONLY</b>. You have to make sure you have a confirmed spot on Meetup (waiting list available).</p> <p>IF you sign up and find out can’t make it, please make sure you cancel your spot so someone else can step in instead.</p> <p>If you DO know Android already, please leave space for those who don’t - come and join GDG Düsseldorf/Women Techmakers at one of our monthly events instead, where we discuss and learn new technologies - maybe you even have an interesting topic you would like to present?</p> <p>PS! The event starts ON TIME. and runs over the whole weekend. We expect to be running from 10 to aprox. 5 pm (17:00) both days but if the team decides together that you want to call it a day earlier - that's up to the group.

Let’s see if Flutter lets us create apps for Android and IOS and can keep up with Native apps. To test this Dylan decided to create an app for the blog Betty’s Kitchen (<a href=\"https://bettyskitchen.nl/\" class=\"linkified\">https://bettyskitchen.nl/</a>) that runs on both Android and IOS and will walk you through how he did this and what he learned along the way.</p> <p>“I'm an Android developer working at Karify (<a href=\"https://karify.com\" class=\"linkified\">https://karify.com</a>) where we are creating an E-health platform for mental health institutions to communicate, treat and manage clients.

Then we will briefly compare with the other alternative solutions. Lastly, we will see how easy it is to connect Google’s Firebase infrastructure to have cloud connected devices.</p> <p>“I am a Google Developer Expert on Android and Firebase and work at Novoda, Berlin.

And you will learn how those DSLs work and how to create your own DSL based on that knowledge.</p> <p>We are looking forward to see you on October 5th!<br/>Your GDG Organiser team</p> ","how_to_find_us":"Vodafone Court, the same location like last meetup at Vodafone","visibility":"public"},{"created":1522395556000,"duration":10800000,"id":"249255747","name":"#GDGDus - Fingerprint Dialog AND Kubernetes for Java Developers","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1524070800000,"local_date":"2018-04-18","local_time":"19:00","updated":1535708727000,"utc_offset":7200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":38,"venue":{"id":23659679,"name":"Vodafone GmbH","lat":51.23583221435547,"lon":6.732470989227295,"repinned":false,"address_1":"Ferdinand-Braun-Platz 1","city":"Düsseldorf","country":"de","localized_country_name":"Germany"},"group":{"created":1385025205000,"name":"GDG Düsseldorf","id":11192732,"join_mode":"open","lat":51.2400016784668,"lon":6.789999961853027,"urlname":"Google-Developer-Group-Dusseldorf","who":"Techies","localized_location":"Düsseldorf, Germany","state":"","country":"de","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Berlin"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/Google-Developer-Group-Dusseldorf/events/249255747/","manual_attendance_count":30,"description":"<p>Hey GDG'ers,</p> <p>we do continue and we never stop, the next meetup is coming with 2 amazing talks by Segun about Androids Fingerprint Dialog and Randy about Kubernetes for Java Developers.</p> <p>Take a look at the abstracts, very interesting !!!</p> <p>The location is set. Check the map. It is again the event \"court\" place at Vodafone Campus.</p> <p>The location will be sponsored by Vodafone.</p> <p>Topic: One Fingerprint Dialog to rule them all.</p> <p>Abstract:<br/>Recently, Android P developer preview was announced and there are a couple of exciting changes and new updates. Some of the changes include support for display cut-outs aka \"notches\", multi-camera APIs, support for indoor positioning with RTT and security updates such as a new unified fingerprint dialog API.</p> <p>Fingerprint authentication is becoming increasingly popular in apps these days and developers have used the FingerPrintManager class to implement it in their apps. With this approach, the responsibility of implementing the UI lies on the developer. This has resulted in fragmentation and inconsistencies for the users.</p> <p>In this talk, we shall be looking at the new Fingerprint Dialog API. We will look at the rationale behind this change, and how to implement the new APIs whether you are porting your old apps or starting from scratch. We will also look at how to handle results for the authentication and tips for failing gracefully.</p> <p>Oluwasegun Famisa is an android expert and working for Trivago.</p> <p>Kubernetes for Java Developers</p> <p>Building production ready (micro) services with java and the details that need to be taken care of when you‘re planning to deploy your application to kubernetes. How health checks should be configured, memory leaks can be unveiled even in production and a short discussion about which base image should be used will be the subject of this talk.</p> <p>Randy Gupta is a Software Architect, CEO of SCARATEC and GDG Düsseldorf organiser.</p> ","how_to_find_us":"We already had a couple of meetups at this location.

After this talk which includes a live demo, you will be able to create your own animations with the Flare web tool and integrate and access them properly with Flutter. In the second part of the talk we will investigate how to build a simple game with the key concepts of general animations in Flutter.</p> <p>Our second guest is Rafael Miranda:</p> <p>Curious at heart, Rafael loves trying out new technologies. Exploring voice interfaces was love at first hearing. He organized hackathons and other events with focus on Alexa before joining Amazon. As a technical evangelist for Amazon Alexa, he educates developers, designers, enthusiasts, and businesses about voice technology.</p> <p>From hearing train station announcements to a pleasant conversation, voice is a natural and ever-present part of most of our lives. We had to learn to click, type, and swipe to communicate with technology. Alexa uses the most natural form of communication, speech, to provide an intuitive interface.

Our GDG Cloud chapter have a meetup with external speakers the same day at a different location, so please make sure you note down the correct event location if you are joining!</p> <p>PS! A follow-up event is planned, some weeks after I/O, where we can dig deeper into whatever news Sundar Pichai and the teams at Google will present - but as we don't know what will be presented until the very moment they go on stage, you will have to wait for those details.</p> ","how_to_find_us":"We will meet you at the door.

The second talk will be held by Amanda Cavallaro who is a Google Developer Expert for Google Assistant from London.</p> <p>Breaking a world record using GCP</p> <p>Emma has calculated 31.4 trillion digits of Pi in 2019 and broke the world record in the Pi computation. The process took about four months and 200 TiB of storage. Record-breaking Pi calculations have traditionally been done on supercomputers and special-made hardware, but Emma and her team did it on Cloud for the first time.</p> <p>This talk will discuss the nature of the calculation, the architecture, challenges and techniques, and of course the brief history of Pi computation. Calculating Pi has been the speaker's childhood dream and this talk will also explain how the small dream grew to the new world record.</p> <p>Building Conversational Actions Using Actions on Google</p> <p>In this session, Amanda Cavallaro will describe the key components of Actions on Google, she is going to show you how to build and design assistant apps using tools such as dialogflow, google cloud platform, actions on google that will delight your users.
