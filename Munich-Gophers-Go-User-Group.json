At TNG Technology Consulting, we use OpenPGP-encrypted mail extensively for confidential conversations. However, its usability for the general public is still not great - problems include long setup procedures, lost passphrases, and the difficulty of finding out if your communications partners can actually decrypt what you sent them. Using a Key Validation Server written in Go, we attempt to overcome the last problem with the help of automation: With this server you can test if your OpenPGP setup works as intended, and your key gains a machine-readable signature certifying this. Other clients can then use this as a hint to automatically encrypt email going to you. In addition to presenting the validation handshake, we will have a look into the details of handling emails with Go, have fun with MIME and hack x/crypto/openpgp.</p> <p><b>Johannes Ebke</b> is Senior Consultant at TNG Technology Consulting. Formerly analyzing data on the grid as a particle physicist at CERN, he's now working on cloud-based distributed web systems.

She'll talk about how they started and why they decided to use Go.</p> <p>Some of the tips she'll address include:<br/>• Dependency injection<br/>• Consistent code structure<br/>• Custom solutions: Fx and Glue<br/>• Monorepo</p> <p>Come learn where they failed and how that led them to solutions that they think are pretty darn neat.</p> <p>Lena Morozova is a software engineer at the Go Platform Team at Uber where she works on Uber's Go ecosystem and wants to make Go experience more enjoyable at Uber. She is a co-organizer of the Women Who Go San Francisco meetup. She is excited about Go, hiking, and dancing.</p> <p>Artem Khvastunov from Jetbrains will give us a behind-the-scenes look into GoLand. We live in a rapidly changing world. Every year Apple releases new macOS, Google ships Go once in six months, every five seconds Boeing 737 departs or lands, and once in a second a new JS framework appears or dies. It's a challenge to promptly adapt to all the changes and preserve quality at the same time. In this talk, I'll speak about processes and tools GoLand team uses to release a new version of the IDE every four months.</p> <p>Some quick facts about Artem:<br/>- Software developer at JetBrains<br/>- Works on GoLand for more than a year<br/>- Previously worked on PhpStorm<br/>- Loves outdoor activities like hiking, biking, and snowboarding<br/>- Lives in Munich, Germany</p> ","visibility":"public"}],"organizers":[{"id":31395412,"name":"Sergii K.","status":"active","joined":1322078286000,"city":"München","country":"de","localized_country_name":"Germany","lat":48.14,"lon":11.58,"photo":{"id":189314792,"highres_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/3/9/c/8/highres_189314792.jpeg","photo_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/3/9/c/8/member_189314792.jpeg","thumb_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/3/9/c/8/thumb_189314792.jpeg","type":"member","base_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com"},"group_profile":{"status":"active","visited":1560187194000,"created":1396733146000,"updated":1484576614000,"role":"coorganizer","group":{"id":13747262,"urlname":"Munich-Gophers-Go-User-Group","name":"GDG Munich Gophers","status":"active","who":"Gophers","members":1005,"join_mode":"open","localized_location":"München, Germany"},"intro":"data guy with Python, R, Julia and Go","link":"https://www.meetup.com/Munich-Gophers-Go-User-Group/members/31395412/"},"is_pro_admin":false},{"id":100446932,"name":"Dmitry S.","status":"active","joined":1372755626000,"city":"München","country":"de","localized_country_name":"Germany","lat":48.14,"lon":11.58,"photo":{"id":129285922,"highres_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/b/3/6/2/highres_129285922.jpeg","photo_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/b/3/6/2/member_129285922.jpeg","thumb_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/b/3/6/2/thumb_129285922.jpeg","type":"member","base_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com"},"group_profile":{"status":"active","visited":1559828721000,"created":1397047463000,"updated":1398414984000,"role":"coorganizer","group":{"id":13747262,"urlname":"Munich-Gophers-Go-User-Group","name":"GDG Munich Gophers","status":"active","who":"Gophers","members":1005,"join_mode":"open","localized_location":"München, Germany"},"intro":"Excited about Go - a modern and versatile language that brings fun back to programming","link":"https://www.meetup.com/Munich-Gophers-Go-User-Group/members/100446932/"},"is_pro_admin":false},{"id":100869192,"name":"Dominic P.","status":"active","joined":1373021613000,"city":"München","country":"de","localized_country_name":"Germany","lat":48.14,"lon":11.58,"photo":{"id":252695767,"highres_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/8/b/b/7/highres_252695767.jpeg","photo_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/8/b/b/7/member_252695767.jpeg","thumb_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/8/b/b/7/thumb_252695767.jpeg","type":"member","base_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com"},"group_profile":{"status":"active","visited":1559899519000,"created":1396731662000,"updated":1536589539000,"role":"organizer","group":{"id":13747262,"urlname":"Munich-Gophers-Go-User-Group","name":"GDG Munich Gophers","status":"active","who":"Gophers","members":1005,"join_mode":"open","localized_location":"München, Germany"},"intro":"Software Engineer","link":"https://www.meetup.com/Munich-Gophers-Go-User-Group/members/100869192/"},"is_pro_admin":false},{"id":189132322,"name":"Felix G.","status":"active","joined":1435302535000,"city":"München","country":"de","localized_country_name":"Germany","lat":48.14,"lon":11.58,"photo":{"id":257081857,"highres_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/3/8/1/highres_257081857.jpeg","photo_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/3/8/1/member_257081857.jpeg","thumb_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/a/3/8/1/thumb_257081857.jpeg","type":"member","base_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com"},"group_profile":{"status":"active","visited":1560251580000,"created":1463423872000,"updated":1549264097000,"role":"coorganizer","group":{"id":13747262,"urlname":"Munich-Gophers-Go-User-Group","name":"GDG Munich Gophers","status":"active","who":"Gophers","members":1005,"join_mode":"open","localized_location":"München, Germany"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/Munich-Gophers-Go-User-Group/members/189132322/"},"is_pro_admin":false}]}
