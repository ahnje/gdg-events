It turns out that these words have multiple meanings... and when businesses don’t know the differences, they run into a world of problems. We’ll go back to basics and strip away the jargon to see what’s really behind the magician’s stand-in simple analogies. Let’s take a look at what’s easy, what’s hard, how to spot opportunities, and what you need to know to avoid the two biggest threats in AI. Along the way, we’ll meet an emerging discipline that focuses on using machine learning and AI to improve your business: decision intelligence engineering! Moreover, we'll talk about Tensorflow and it's applications.</p> <p>MLCC is intended for those who wish to learn about ML from a practical, applied perspective that will enable them to use machine learning within their everyday projects, and who wish to benefit from the power of TensorFlow wrapped in convenient higher-level abstractions.<br/>This is a great opportunity for an audience with basic technical knowledge and limited Machine Learning knowledge willing to gain some practical experience in ML and TensorFlow.</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1541010192000,"duration":30600000,"id":"256006529","name":"GDG Surat DevFest Season'18","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1542510000000,"local_date":"2018-11-18","local_time":"08:30","updated":1545394949000,"utc_offset":19800000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":99,"venue":{"id":25980321,"name":"Shree Swami Atmanand Saraswati Institute of Technology","lat":21.2197208404541,"lon":72.87265014648438,"repinned":true,"address_1":" Opp. Police Station, Varachha Main Rd, Kapodra Patiya, Surat, Gujarat 395006","city":"Surat","country":"in","localized_country_name":"India"},"group":{"created":1537811734000,"name":"Google Developer Group : GDG Surat","id":29946762,"join_mode":"open","lat":21.200000762939453,"lon":72.81999969482422,"urlname":"GDG_Surat","who":"Members","localized_location":"Surat, India","state":"","country":"in","region":"en_US","timezone":"Asia/Calcutta"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG_Surat/events/256006529/","manual_attendance_count":153,"description":"<p>GDG DevFest 2018 is our annual all-day developer conference that offers speaker sessions across multiple product areas, code labs, hackathon and more!</p> <p>This year we are coming up with exciting technologies that may help you in broader aspects of your professional life.
