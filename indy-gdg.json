This our first technical meetup in quite some time. We will be talking about Google's new Flutter technology and will have a workshop helping people get set up with Flutter on their machines and possibly get a simple app going! There will be pizza and zWorks will also offer additional drinks and snacks.</p> <p>\"Flutter is Google’s mobile app SDK for crafting high-quality native interfaces on iOS and Android in record time. Flutter works with existing code, is used by developers and organizations around the world, and is free and open source.\"</p> <p>More information here: <a href=\"https://flutter.io/\" class=\"linkified\">https://flutter.io/</a></p> <p>Requirements/Suggestions:<br/>- Make sure to bring a Mac or a Windows laptop, either will work fine for the workshop portion of the event.<br/>- Attendees should try to play around with the first few steps of the setup themselves beforehand since there are a lot of steps involved, but this is not a must.<br/>- Having an Android emulator pre-installed will save a lot of time in setting up the Flutter environment.</p> <p>This meetup will be loosely based on the first few parts of the Udacity course by the Google Flutter Development team found here: <a href=\"https://www.udacity.com/course/build-native-mobile-apps-with-flutter--ud905\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.udacity.com/course/build-native-mobile-apps-with-flutter--ud905</a></p> <p>UPDATE for workshop:<br/>For the demo(s), we will be using Visual Studio Code on a Windows computer and will be running the app on an Android Emulator.
