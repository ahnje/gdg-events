Everything seems like it should be working. You’ve looked over this code 20 times, but you can’t figure out why it’s failing. You’re frustrated, and you’re ready to give up.</p> <p>Even with the simplest of problems, we can get stuck. It happens to engineers of all experience levels - new hires and senior engineers alike. The key to success as a developer is knowing how to get yourself unstuck.</p> <p>In this session, we’ll start by reframing the act of getting stuck as a positive. Then we’ll talk about many strategies for identifying the problem and moving on. We’ll discuss the psychology behind these strategies, and answer questions like “Why do my best ideas come to me in the shower?” Finally, we’ll look at ways to harden yourself for the next time you get stuck.</p> <p>Getting unstuck is a skill. This session will help you sharpen that skill, and prepare you for the next time you want to throw your keyboard out a window.\"</p> <p>This online meetup hosted on Google Hangouts by Andromeda. <a href=\"https://www.andromeda16.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.andromeda16.com/</a></p> <p>- - - - -<br/>SPEAKER BIO</p> <p>Steven Hicks is a web development generalist with nearly 20 years experience.

Sometimes they don't know when they should do it, so it ends up being overapplied. Sometimes they don't really know what it is, so they end up treating it in odd ways.</p> <p>In this talk, you'll get answers for all of the above and more. You'll understand TDD better, you'll understand how to be more effective, and you'll learn to let go of that little voice that says you should do more.</p> <p>This online meetup hosted on Google Hangouts by Andromeda. <a href=\"https://www.andromeda16.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.andromeda16.com/</a></p> <p>- - - - -<br/>SPEAKER BIO</p> <p>Gary Fleming is an agile coach, software crafter, and systems thinker.
