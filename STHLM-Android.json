It will go on for a full day (or until the last person leaves) and we hope to see lots of cool presentations and hear interesting discussions. While it is not required that you do a presentation yourself, we do expect everyone to participate actively.</p> <p>The event will be hosted at the co-working space THINGS at the KTH Campus (see <a href=\"http://www.thingstockholm.com/\"><a href=\"http://www.thingstock\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.thingstock</a>...</a>­) and we will be serving lunch (Pizza!) and provide some beers as well. We will have access to two separate rooms with a projector in each. The event will start with a planing session where everyone can suggest their own presentation and we will decide on the schedule together. We will bring Post-Its and pens as well as converters for the projectors. There will also be a WiFi available at the event.</p> <p>To make this a bit more exciting, Google has provided us with a few gifts. The plan is to use these as awards for the best sessions or demos, all which will be decided by the participants. We currently have an LG Watch urbane (Android Wear), two Nexus Players (Android TV), Chromecast, Google Cardboards and a couple of Bluetooth beacons compatible with Android Nearby and Eddystone. While we do plan to give these away by the end of the day, we would also like to see people use them for their presentations and demos if possible.</p> <p>If you have any questions regarding the event, please don't hesitate to contact us.</p> <p>Finally, we also hope to see you at the DroidCon event starting this Thursday.

The letter shape dictates the overall feel and sentiment of every application where it’s used. As for design and layout, a font is made for a key purpose, and can’t fit all needs at the same time, (that’s why more than one is usually needed).</p> <p>Since commercial font licenses for application can be very expensive, and the font software is often made for general use, rather than your applications needs, maybe it’s time to design or commission your own?</p> <p>This keynote will take you trough the choices and many aspects of type design in 2016.</p> <p><i><b>Architecting Modern Android Apps</b></i><br/>Samuel Wejéus (Screen Interaction)</p> <p>When asked about architecture of their app most people answer that they use either fragments or activities. But is that really the correct level of abstraction? What about internal app architecture? Should we really let the framework dictate how we architect our applications?</p> <p>This is a story of how we rose from chaos by ignoring Android conventions and migrated to use-case driven architecture.

Mobile at scale at Lyft.</b></p> <p><i>Sebastian Brannstrom, Lyft</i></p> <p>At Lyft we build apps at scale. Today, a team of over 40 people spread across a dozen teams push out new versions of our apps for iPhone and Android on a weekly basis. But it wasn't always like this. I'll talk about how we got from our humble beginnings with a pair of engineers back in 2012 to the machine that we have today. </p> <p>While we have good reasons to be proud of where we are, plenty of mistakes were made along the way. We had to try many tools and processes to find what worked for us at the time, and to set ourselves up for success in the future.</p> <p>Just as Lyft and the industry has reached this plateau of productivity, new exciting things are on the horizon. Smart digital assistants, chat bots and new web technologies are challenging the app as the default platform. Have we perhaps reached peak mobile?</p> <p><i>Sebastian</i> is originally from Stockholm. He has been programming since his teens. He fell into mobile in 2006 when he got his first Symbian phone. It couldn't do podcasts, so he wrote an app for that and open sourced it. He was then hired by Symbian and moved to London. After leaving Symbian, Sebastian was employee #11 at Lyft. He wrote the first iteration of the Lyft app as a Hackathon project in 2012. After overseeing the mobile team for three years, he moved into a new role leading the engineering efforts for autonomous software. Now he spends his time sorting out paperwork for his new home in San Francisco and threatening to move to the second Lyft engineering office in Seattle. Sebastian is currently at Burning man, which is why Alex wrote his bio. We hope he finds himself but doesn't lose his voice! </p> <p><b>Practical Bluetooth LE</b></p> <p><i>Erik Hellman</i></p> <p>Bluetooth Low Energy was announced for Android 4.3 (Jelly Bean MR2, API level 18) and the API has received some updates with each new version since then. Unfortunately, the way the API works and the number of undocumented \"features\" in the Bluetooth stack on Android has made it very difficult to work with. Regardless if you're doing something simple like scanning for beacons or doing two-way communication with another device, you're bound to run into problems that can be both hard to identify and difficult to fix.</p> <p>In this talk we will go through the most common pitfalls regarding Bluetooth LE on Android and how to deal with them. You'll learn how to properly scan for devices, connect to them, and exchange data.</p> <p>Welcome!</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1475325433000,"id":"234547739","name":"Android Meetup with Realm and Microsoft at Foo Café Stockholm","rsvp_limit":60,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1476979200000,"local_date":"2016-10-20","local_time":"18:00","rsvp_open_offset":"PT1H","updated":1476991715000,"utc_offset":7200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":2,"group":{"created":1399660238000,"name":"GDG Stockholm Android","id":14359052,"join_mode":"open","lat":59.33000183105469,"lon":18.06999969482422,"urlname":"STHLM-Android","who":"Members","localized_location":"Stockholm, Sweden","state":"","country":"se","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Stockholm"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/STHLM-Android/events/234547739/","description":"<p>We're thrilled to announce our first Android Meetup in cooperation with Foo Café Stockholm.

The aim of this talk is first of all to create the functional reactive programming mindset; to explain what an Observable and a Subscriber are; and to give a bit of insight in the magic of thread handling in RxJava. We will then take a practical example, see how RxJava can be applied and what its advantages are compared to other options.I will end the talk by addressing an important question: how to best proceed to integrate RxJava into an existing app.  </p> <p><b>Title:</b> A Journey Through MV Wonderland<br/><b>Abstract:<br/></b>Developing an app with a design that changes every few months means that the architecture chosen for the UI has to facilitate change. How do you react fast to UI changes, with minimum amount of code? What pattern is the best for testability? Which pattern gives you most decoupling of classes? MVC, MVP and MVVM are the most popular architecture patterns for implementing user interfaces. Join me on a journey to discover the advantages and disadvantages associated with of each of these and find the best one. We will perform a deep dive into the implementations and tests for each pattern. Learn about the pitfalls that you can expect and how you can avoid them, based on some of the lessons that we have learned.</p> <p><b>Speaker bio: <br/></b>Florina passionately works at upday as a Senior Android Developer.

It can be as simple as moving a few files, and maybe creating a new build config or two along the way, or it can be much more gruelling. At Spotify, it has meant clearing out years and years of tech debt, re-writing APIs, rethinking the architecture and structure of the application and features that go into it, wrestling with build tools, and then some. This talk will walk you through the Spotify modularization journey: why we got started, how we went about it, what we have learned through the process, and also why you should be thinking about modularizing your code if you haven't already started.</p> <p>Bio: Elin is an Android developer in the mobile architecture team at Spotify in Stockholm, working on frameworks, libraries and infrastructure for speeding up development.
