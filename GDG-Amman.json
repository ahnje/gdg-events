This course is intended for those who wish to learn about ML from a practical, applied perspective that will enable them to use machine learning within their everyday projects, and who wish to benefit from the power of TensorFlow wrapped in convenient higher-level abstractions. This is a great opportunity for professionals, entrepreneurs, and students to gain some practical experience in ML and TensorFlow.</p> <p>This course will be suitable for you, if:<br/>- You are a strong programmer<br/>- Ideally, you are at least somewhat familiar with Python. You don't need to be an expert.<br/>- Ideally, you know at least a little about linear algebra and calculus.</p> <p>This course is not recommended for:<br/>- Participants with extensive machine learning backgrounds.<br/>- Participants looking to learn about the lower-level intricacies of raw TensorFlow.<br/>Although the course does contain some basic TensorFlow exercises, most of the exercises focus on high-level Tensor APIs.<br/>Participants seeking advanced topics in machine learning such as image conventional models and recurrent/sequential models.</p> <p>The format of this course:<br/>We will be walking you through MLCC, its modules, and basic ML concepts. Additionally, we will have you go through selected modules of the course, with a teaching assistant guiding you in course’s practical pieces/exercises and troubleshooting and pieces of the content where you are struggling. The course is open to all so you can complete the remaining modules as a self-study after the session.</p> <p>Other requirements? Additionally, we’d need you to bring:<br/>- Your laptop and charger. You will need this to go through the online course.<br/>- Pen &amp; paper (or any other preferable option if you plan to take notes)<br/>A can-do attitude!</p> <p>Interested?<br/>- Register here: <a href=\"https://forms.gle/ipBCdWPGeeztjoVs9\" class=\"linkified\">https://forms.gle/ipBCdWPGeeztjoVs9</a> by 20 April.</p> <p>Selected attendees would be notified by 25 April.
