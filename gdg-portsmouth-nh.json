We were going to kick off GDG Portsmouth with a Study Jam on Kubernetes Feb 16th but our facility fell through. We're looking diligently for a replacement venue but more than likely we'll need to push this meetup out a week or two. I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience. Hopefully it is not too late to find something else fun to do this weekend! We'll keep you posted. Stay tuned!</p> <p>-----------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>We're going to kick off GDG Portsmouth NH with what we call a Study Jam. What is a Study Jam you may ask? Well, basically we grab a 4 hour block of time on a Saturday and start working our way through a course/quest on Qwiklabs.com. This year we're aiming to host 4 of these events. The topics will be Kubernetes, IoT, Machine Learning and Security. Stay tuned for the official announcement of topic, time and location. I promise you won't have to wait too long. Feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions.</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1549156519000,"duration":129600000,"id":"258633028","name":"Droidcon Boston 2019 - 20% off Code","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1554728400000,"local_date":"2019-04-08","local_time":"09:00","updated":1554863387000,"utc_offset":-14400000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":2,"venue":{"id":26140230,"name":"Boston Center for the Arts","lat":42.34452438354492,"lon":-71.07086944580078,"repinned":true,"address_1":"539 Tremont St","city":"Boston","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"02116","state":"MA"},"group":{"created":1546998515000,"name":"GDG Portsmouth NH","id":30877910,"join_mode":"open","lat":43.06999969482422,"lon":-70.77999877929688,"urlname":"gdg-portsmouth-nh","who":"Members","localized_location":"Portsmouth, NH","state":"NH","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Eastern"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdg-portsmouth-nh/events/258633028/","description":"<p>Hi All,</p> <p>Quick update.
