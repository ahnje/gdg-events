We were going to kick off GDG Portsmouth with a Study Jam on Kubernetes Feb 16th but our facility fell through. We're looking diligently for a replacement venue but more than likely we'll need to push this meetup out a week or two. I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience. Hopefully it is not too late to find something else fun to do this weekend! We'll keep you posted. Stay tuned!</p> <p>-----------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>We're going to kick off GDG Portsmouth NH with what we call a Study Jam. What is a Study Jam you may ask? Well, basically we grab a 4 hour block of time on a Saturday and start working our way through a course/quest on Qwiklabs.com. This year we're aiming to host 4 of these events. The topics will be Kubernetes, IoT, Machine Learning and Security. Stay tuned for the official announcement of topic, time and location. I promise you won't have to wait too long. Feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions.</p> ","visibility":"public"}]
