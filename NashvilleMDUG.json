been building about Google's Project Tango.  As of now, this project takes the shape of a tablet-sized Android device that is capable of constructing a three-dimensional model of its environment in real time, and presenting a 3D view of the reconstructed model on the device.  An application can also track the device's location in space as it moves around, with 6 degrees of articulation.  The Project Tango has a horrible name, but is a neat piece of technology.</p> <p>Come with your hacker buddies and form a team, or be ready to work with other free agents to conceptualize and assemble an app prototype.  During this one-day hackathon, each team will implement its own idea for a Tango app, ending the day with a presentation of the product, finished or not!  Project apps can be built from scratch, or pre-existing apps can be targetted and rebuilt for the Tango during the hackathon.  The projects will be judged by our celebrity panel, and five project tango devices will be awarded to the winning team.  To compensate for the fact that some pre-built apps will obviously have more polish, apps built from scratch on the day of the event will receive extra points toward the end-of-day competition.  </p> <p><b>All prospective participants should <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1zIJkK-uo91g5P6Wsk0T4TT0uj8HBzEpErmqM09hnVL0/viewform\">complete our

restrictions.</b></p> <p>Developers: Bring your computer for assembling an app which will target the Tango device.  Each team will be provided a Tango to use for development for the day.</p> <p>The hackathon isn't just for coders -- teams will want designers, graphics artists, asset finders, and decision makers!  A team should be comprised of no more than 5 participants.</p> <p>We'll have food for the entire day, so come hungry and plan to stay.  There will of course be SWAG for all, possibly including a Durovis Dive virtual reality headset.  We'll also have some ongoing distractions to keep everybody awake, perhaps including a live music jam!</p> <p>See you then.</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1443732157000,"id":"225761145","name":"Mobile Development

User Group hosted our first annual epic Cage Match, pitting the two nastiest contenders, Android and iOS, against one another in a battle to the death.  Or, 7:30 PM -- whichever came first.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the bell rang ending the bout before any death blows could be dealt, so this time, Android and iOS are on the same tag team: <b>Native Mobile Development</b>, set to battle their bitter enemies:  <b>Mobile Web Development</b> and <b>Hybrid Mobile Development</b>.</p> <p>The purview of the Native team ought to be fairly obvious: these are guys who write native Android and iOS code for a living, and that's the paradigm they believe in.  The other teams may <i>seem</i> unfamiliar, but you see their products every day.  Mobile Web Development is the practice of building web content with an eye toward the mobile screen, considering responsive design principles.  The areas of expertise on this team encompass the entire pantheon of mobile web development including HTML5, JavaScript, web servers, and CDNs.</p> <p>What do we mean by Hybrid Mobile Development?  This is the assembly of mobile apps employing a framework that bypasses the traditional mobile SDK's, typically allowing the developer to build for multiple mobile platforms from a single codebase.  This includes a vast range of development paradigms, ranging from popular toolsets like Xamarin and Titanium to such established and controversial libraries as Phonegap or React.  We can't possibly represent all of these fields of expertise, so we'll limit it to a couple of developers who are passionate champions of their chosen framework.</p> <p>These three teams will answer our questions in a public forum, with a central moderator posing talking points and restraining the bloodthirsty opponents when necessary.</p> <p>You can nominate panel members with <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/14i6LSDjSAx9hQqAS4VBWQj6r7oiRyhNgP4yOoaLG0u4/viewform\">this</a> form and submit your own questions

another Android Study Group!</p> <p>In this meetup, Joseph Banta will go over the curriculum for the 2016 Android Study Group project published by Udacity, and discuss the format of the Study Group meetings to come.  We will tentatively plan to have 4 or 5 weekly meetings starting the first week in February.</p> <p>In our Study Group sessions, we will walk through the steps to create a functional Android app.  2015's Study Group was a great success, and 12 programmers with little or no Android programming experience got through the 6-session course and submitted their final projects for certification by Google and Udacity.  This year we aim to have at least as many complete the course.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.udacity.com/course/android-development-for-beginners--ud837\">2016's project</a> is <b>a lot</b> simpler to complete than last year's.  They apparently figured out that people didn't want to know how to make a complicated app -- just a simple one.  That's the premise for this course, so if there is sufficient interest we can follow this beginner's group up with one that targets more intricate functionality.</p> <p>Auditors are welcome.  Even if you don't intend to complete the project, you can come and see what this kind of development entails, and (maybe more interestingly) who is doing it!  Expect pizza...</p> <p>Below is a link to the Udacity curriculum:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.udacity.com/course/android-development-for-beginners--ud837\"><a
