The main programming language on Android is Java. Android offers a comprehensive API to apps running on the Dalvik VM. The API covers a large part of the Java standard library in addition to Android specific APIs. Android includes tooling to convert Java .class files to Dalvik VM compatible class files. Ruboto uses JRuby to allow you to run Ruby scripts on the Dalvik VM. Using Ruby code, you have access to the complete Android API.</p> <p>This presentation will introduce the different parts of Ruboto. Come see what Ruboto has to offer.</p> <p>18:15-19:00: Gaël Pouzerate - \"One Million Downloads\"</p> <p>Gaël has developed an app named <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.gpo.greenpower&amp;hl=en\">GreenPower</a>. After two years work and a lot of effort, the app has now been downloaded over 1.2 million times from the Google Play Store.</p> <p>During this time Android development went from being a hobby activity with a few daily downloads, to quitting his regular job and start working full time on the project.</p> <p>Gaël has learned a lot of do's and don'ts about how to make an app successful and climb up the charts. In this presentation, he will provide a humble feedback on this journey, and try to bring advices that may be useful for other developers.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1360240105000,"id":"103477952","name":"GDG Oslo - 2013:02 Meetup","rsvp_limit":50,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1361980800000,"local_date":"2013-02-27","local_time":"17:00","updated":1361992244000,"utc_offset":3600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":44,"venue":{"id":11713682,"name":"Mesh","lat":59.913177490234375,"lon":10.736336708068848,"repinned":true,"address_1":"Tordenskiolds gate 3","city":"Oslo","country":"no","localized_country_name":"Norway"},"group":{"created":1352880997000,"name":"GDG Oslo","id":5840872,"join_mode":"open","lat":59.90999984741211,"lon":10.75,"urlname":"GDGOslo","who":"Members","localized_location":"Oslo, Norway","state":"","country":"no","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Oslo"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDGOslo/events/103477952/","description":"<p><b>17:00-17:30: Mingling + food</b></p> <p>Meet other GDG Oslo members before the presentations start.

This presentation covers the basics of JavaScript, from variables and functions to inheritance and classes. We will also see how its asynchronous execution affects us and how we can handle it.</p> <p>Tine is a developer at Bekk Consulting and is currently working on Java and JavaScript projects. She has a keen interest in JavaScript and fights to keep the spaghetti code at bay. This can and have been done in multiple ways and with a myriad of frameworks, but with the continuous innovation in the JS world there is still much to embrace.</p> <p> </p> <p><b>18:15-19:00: August Lilleaas - \"Introduction to AngularJS\"</b></p> <p>What is AngularJS all about?

As we no longer need to battle DOM differences we can focus on building our applications instead. Now, however, as more and more application logic move from the server to the client our main problem is that we need to unlearn our earlier DOM-centric approach to JavaScript. Tools such as Backbone and Angular help, but before we are able to use them effectively we have to change some of our neural pathways.

Managing the dependencies between modules and setting up a complete environment is hard and growing harder by the number of modules. This talk will give an introduction to Docker and show how keeping all modules as self-contained Docker-containers helps managing these dependencies. A complete workflow showing how I implement and share a change across modules will be showcased, running from my laptop to my production environment in the Google Cloud Platform. </p> <p>Trond Marius works as CTO and Principal Consultant at Mesan. He is on a constant lookout for ways to simplify everyday life, both for developers and operations. Trond Marius has a broad experience developing and running systems using primarily Java, Scala and Clojure - both with and without the use of Docker. </p> <p><b>17:45-18:30 Using Chrome DevTools To Adapt Apps For Smaller Screens </b><br/>Trond Kjetil Bremnes (appear.in)</p> <p>TK from <a href=\"http://appear.in/\">appear.in</a> is going to share some of their learnings from shrinking their existing web application, reworking it to fit smaller handheld screens. In this talk, we'll explore some of the lesser known treasures in Chrome DevTools. Whether you are just starting on developing an app for small screens or are adapting your existing app to smaller screens, we'll show you how Chrome DevTools can aid you in your quest.</p> <p>Android user, web idealist, pragmatist, TK is a front end developer for <a href=\"http://appear.in/\">appear.in</a>. For the time being, working on mobilizing their web client. </p> <p><b>18:30-19:15 Web Components and Polymer</b> <br/>Thomas Bassetto (Soundrop)</p> <p>From <i>&lt;a&gt;</i> to <i>&lt;select&gt;</i>, elements are the building blocks of the web. But modern applications have outgrown these built-in elements, forcing app developers to rely on JavaScript frameworks to provide dynamic, custom behavior. The resulting apps are frequently complex and monolithic; a component developed for one may not work in another. In this talk we'll take a look at the Web Components specs as well as Polymer, a new library that allows developers to create their own HTML elements and compose them into complete applications today.</p> <p>Thomas is a Software Engineer at Soundrop. He previously worked for several startups in Paris where he designed apps for desktop and TV using web technologies as well as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joli_OS\">a somewhat successful HTML5 operating system for netbooks</a>.</p> <p><b>19:15-19:45 Food<br/></b> Food and drinks, kindly sponsored by <a href=\"http://www.mesan.no\">Mesan</a></p> <p><b>19:45-20:15 Designing for Android Wear</b><br/>John-Eivind Hallen (Shortcut)</p> <p>Abstract TBA</p> <p><b>20:15-20:45 Developing for Android Wear</b><br/>Thomas Oldervoll (Zenior) </p> <p>This talk will show you how to build an Android Wear app. Thomas will start out with a plain notification and show you how to add features until you have a full-fledged card UI. We will discuss the role of the phone and the watch and how to communicate between them. As a case study he will use a prototype for a news alert app he's working on - there will be plenty of code examples and demos.</p> <p>Thomas Oldervoll has worked 5 years for Google in Mountain View and 9 years for Zenior in Oslo.

Sinett 3.0 programme at Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (FFI)</i></p> <p>Following the disruptive change from desktop to mobile computing there is a large, pent up demand for custom/internal apps in many large organisations. A key problem for these organisations is the clash between the need for advanced apps and the possibilities for non-developers internally in the organisation to create such apps. Complex apps requires professional programmers (increasing time and cost) whereas current non-developer tools usually result in rather basic apps.</p> <p>To allow non-developers to create advanced apps the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment developed an app builder called Mlab based on re-usable components. The goal was that anyone who knew how to use PowerPoint could create advanced apps through the use of self-contained, interactive components without any programming knowledge.</p> <p>This presentation will discuss how HTML5/JS/CSS enabled the development of the extensible Mlab framework through components. In particular we will examine how our solutions make both the development (by programmers) and use (by app creators) of components quick and simple without sacrificing power. Mlab was initially created for the Norwegian Defence but will soon be generally available.</p> <p>18:00<br/><b>Expect the Unexpected: How to Deal with Errors in JavaScript Applications (Angular, React, Vue, Ionic, etc)</b><br/><i>by Mats Bryntse, Chief JavaScript Officer at Bryntum, Sweden</i></p> <p>Dealing with unexpected exceptions on the server side is something we've all done for ages. Now it's time to apply the same quality goals and monitoring to our JS codebase. This is especially important for large complex web or mobile applications where the front-end usually contains 100k+ lines of code. I'll demonstrate various powerful monitoring techniques and tricks that we are using ourselves at Bryntum.</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1484682964000,"id":"236996164","name":"Google Hash Code","rsvp_limit":40,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1487871000000,"local_date":"2017-02-23","local_time":"18:30","rsvp_close_offset":"PT24H","updated":1487887139000,"utc_offset":3600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":13,"venue":{"id":12875282,"name":"StartupLab","lat":59.94255447387695,"lon":10.716915130615234,"repinned":true,"address_1":"Gaustadaleen 21","city":"Oslo","country":"no","localized_country_name":"Norway"},"group":{"created":1352880997000,"name":"GDG Oslo","id":5840872,"join_mode":"open","lat":59.90999984741211,"lon":10.75,"urlname":"GDGOslo","who":"Members","localized_location":"Oslo, Norway","state":"","country":"no","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Oslo"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDGOslo/events/236996164/","description":"<p>Hash Code is a team-based programming competition organized by Google for students and industry professionals across Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

To better safeguard our data, communications and hashing algorithms, we need to be able to hack our own apps and see what we are exposing. Then we can learn to protect them.

Nå er det tid for den første Kotlin-meetupen, og det er bare å glede seg. I dag skal vi høre Thomas Pettersen snakke om hvor mye Kotlin forenkler livet vårt når det gjelder utvikling for Android. Det blir lett servering med pizza og brus, og muligheter til mingling og diskusjoner etter foredraget.</p> <p>17. mai 2017 kunngjorde Google at Kotlin var offisielt støttet i Android. \"Hurra!\" tenkte vi utviklere, da vi endelig fikk et moderne alternativ til Java. I ettertid har det også kommet flere extensions til Kotlin på Android som har gjort livet svært mye enklere. Siden mai i fjor har han jobbet med apper hvor det har blitt tatt i bruk Kotlin, som Yr og Nabohjelp, og denne talken tar for seg erfaringene i praksis med utvikling av Android-apper i Kotlin. Livet BLIR lettere :D</p> <p>Om foredragsholderen:<br/>Thomas er en meteorologiutdannet programmeringsnerd med mobilt DNA og lidenskap for alt fra IoT til innovasjon. Han har jobbet med Android i Mesan og Netcompany siden 2010 med apper som NRK TV, Yr, Nabohjelp og KvoteAppen. Alltid mye på hjertet som han deler villig vekk!</p> <p>Denne meetupen sponses av Systek og Evry.</p> <p>*** Note that this Meetup will be held in Norwegian 🇳🇴 and that you should RSVP on the Oslo Kotlin Meetup page ➡️ <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/meetup-group-nWeRbyMu/events/251123351/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/meetup-group-nWeRbyMu/events/251123351/</a> ***</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1535520609000,"duration":7200000,"id":"254194636","name":"Firebase Codelabs: Cloud Firestore and Cloud Functions","rsvp_limit":50,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1541174400000,"local_date":"2018-11-02","local_time":"17:00","updated":1541192640000,"utc_offset":3600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":46,"venue":{"id":25026591,"name":"Google Norway","lat":59.90985107421875,"lon":10.726712226867676,"repinned":true,"address_1":"Bryggegata 6","city":"Oslo","country":"no","localized_country_name":"Norway"},"group":{"created":1352880997000,"name":"GDG Oslo","id":5840872,"join_mode":"open","lat":59.90999984741211,"lon":10.75,"urlname":"GDGOslo","who":"Members","localized_location":"Oslo, Norway","state":"","country":"no","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Oslo"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDGOslo/events/254194636/","manual_attendance_count":30,"description":"<p>We are excited to have Susan from the Firebase team visiting Oslo.</p> <p>Susan will lead a codelab where we build an application with Firebase using Cloud Firestore and Cloud Functions.</p> <p>Abstract:</p> <p>When you build an app using Firebase, it takes care of data storage, synchronization, file storage, authentication, and other backend functionalities so that your time is spent polishing user interactions.

This presentation will guide you through the basics of coroutines, compare it to other concurrency models out there, and even show how to test these asynchronous structures. This might be an eye opener to solve many of your future problems.</p> <p>19:00 Break<br/>19:20 Codelabs<br/>21:00 Event ends</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1571990702000,"duration":7200000,"id":"265947127","name":"Build and scale serverless mobile apps with Firebase and Google Cloud","rsvp_limit":55,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1573144200000,"local_date":"2019-11-07","local_time":"17:30","updated":1573217060000,"utc_offset":3600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":50,"venue":{"id":26449859,"name":"Google Norway","lat":59.90986633300781,"lon":10.726070404052734,"repinned":true,"address_1":"Bryggegata 6","city":"Oslo","country":"no","localized_country_name":"Norway"},"group":{"created":1352880997000,"name":"GDG Oslo","id":5840872,"join_mode":"open","lat":59.90999984741211,"lon":10.75,"urlname":"GDGOslo","who":"Members","localized_location":"Oslo, Norway","state":"","country":"no","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Oslo"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDGOslo/events/265947127/","manual_attendance_count":37,"description":"<p>If your app has millions of users, you need a backend infrastructure to support its growth.

Taking your web app offline (in a good sense)<br/>Speaker: Maxim Salnikov - Microsoft<br/>Description:<br/>Web as an application platform is amazing: evergreen browsers or some form of web views exist almost on every device with UI, we have native APIs to access the hardware, we use versatile language with the excellent tooling, we are the huge (the largest ever) developer community after all! But the web historically tightly coupled with the connection state... In my session, we confirm: the modern web APIs and some best practices allow us to build offline-first web apps: always available, caring about data consumption, preserving and sync, providing UX which is comparable (if not better) to the native apps, regardless of the connection. Plus, the current state of the tooling makes it possible to add these features in a fast and reliable way. Let's explore the offline web in a very practical manner - by building the offline-first app!</p> <p>This session will be useful for web front-end developers who have heard about progressive web apps (who haven't :), maybe even tired of PWA-hype, and thus want to understand some of UX benefits on practice. As this is not another \"What is PWA\" session, I focus exclusively on the modern APIs making offline-first approach possible, in a form of task+solution sections - to maximize the usefulness.</p> <p>Backend developers and mobile developers will get a nice overview of what web can do today (they will be impressed).</p> <p>2. Make your app installable<br/>Speaker: Laura Morinigo - Samsung Internet<br/>Description:<br/>A progressive web app is a way to bring a native-app experience into the browser. One of the main features is the ability to make your app installable on different platforms like desktop and smartphones. During this talk, we are going to review what we need to make our app installable, the best practices and standards that we have to follow in order to bring a good user experience, trends and a reference to the manifest file.</p> <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>About our speakers:</p> <p>Maxim Salnikov:</p> <p>This time we are so lucky to be joined by Maxim Salnikov from Microsoft.<br/>Maxim Salnikov is an Oslo-based cloud and web front-end geek with a strong passion for the developer community building.
