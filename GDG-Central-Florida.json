Whether you work in consulting, you're leading a startup or you're looking for your next dream job, this talk is for you. Make sure to follow Brandy on Twitter at @msbrandymorgan. We're also looking forward to learning about Brandy's latest startup, CreatorsCode.co. We can't wait to share the story at our next Google developers meetup!</p> <p>====</p> <p>VueJs and Google FireStore</p> <p>As web developers, we love JavaScript. It gives us the ability to express high impact applications with simplicity. Looking for a scalable platform for building your next killer application? In this meetup, we’ll explore building web apps with Vue.js and Google Cloud Firestore using real application examples. Cloud FireStore provides all the important platform tools for your startup or application: authentication, real-time database, security, analytics, and data query. It’s a great platform to keep you focused on your application. (not infrastructure)</p> <p>We also want to thank TekSystems for providing beer and pizza for our meeting.
