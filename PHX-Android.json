In this case, the \u201cBeginners\u201d are people new to programming as well as new to Android. The only requirements are a computer (hopefully a laptop so you can bring it along), some basic computer usage skills, and a willingness to learn and explore. It has 3 lessons and a final the estimate is that it can be done with a 16-20 hour commitment over the course of a month or so.</p> <p>Getting started with any new course on a subject as complex as Android is a monumental task . . . even with help from the amazing instructors at Udacity. That\u2019s why GDG Phoenix is proud to support the course and is running a \u201cStudy Jam\u201d where we meet regularly (in person and possibly through Google Hangouts) and go over questions people have and provide general support while people do the course. Watching the videos and participating in the course is up to you . . . but we\u2019re here to help and motivate you to reach the Final Project!</p> <p>Feb 25th is the kickoff meeting and first Study Jam but feel free to start RIGHT NOW.

The only requirements are a computer (hopefully a laptop so you can bring it along), some basic computer usage skills, and a willingness to learn and explore.

That\u2019s why GDG Phoenix is proud to support the course and is running a \u201cStudy Jam\u201d where we meet regularly and go over questions people have and provide general support while people do the course.
