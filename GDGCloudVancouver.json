Today her focus is on large scale learning projects including enterprise-wide e-learning strategy and governance, learning management system (LMS) design, development, evaluation and implementation, educational software development, and learning analytics. She is passionate about augmenting technologies to optimize human potentials.</p> <p>Talk: Machine Learning in Corporate E-learning - Some Applications and Trends</p> <p>Abstract: In recent years, a lot of thoughts have been given on the future of organizational learning and some of the emerging trends and how they can be integrated as part of the overarching learning and development roadmap. Among them, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning is one of the hot topic in e-learning in the recent year. Indeed, intelligent and machine driven learning is forecasted to be the evolution of corporate learning by 2020. In this talk, I will present how machine learning algorithms can be applied in corporate e-learning, particularly in shaping the future design of learning management systems (LMS) to make them more flexible, adaptive, and learner-centric. Some examples will be provided to demonstrate how one can potentially track engagement of learners in real time; provide timely and adaptive feedback; and interact with employees using chat bots to address performance challenges.</p> <p>Agenda:</p> <p>08.30 am: Doors Open and Settle down<br/>09:00 am - 09:30 am: Welcome and Introduction<br/>09:30 am - 11:00 am: TensorFlow - Learning Machines<br/>11.00 am - 12.15 pm: Machine Learning Crash Course (Part 1)<br/>12.15 pm - 12.30 pm: Raffle<br/>12.30 pm - 1.30 pm: Lunch Break<br/>1.30 pm - 2.30 pm: Guest Talk by Dr. Stella Lee<br/>2.30 pm - 2.45 pm: Raffle<br/>2.45 pm - 3.45 pm: Machine Learning Crash Course (Part 2)<br/>3.45 pm - 4.00 pm: Coffee and Networking break<br/>4.00 pm - 4.45 pm: More Demos<br/>4.45 pm - 5.00 pm: Closing Remarks by all organizers</p> <p>Please note:<br/>Lunch, Coffee, Snacks will be provided and yes there will be SWAGS !!!</p> <p>PLEASE REMEMBER TO BRING YOUR LAPTOP AS THIS IS A PURE HANDS-ON EVENT.</p> <p>Thank you Eventbase as our host and Google as our general sponsor.</p> ","how_to_find_us":"The organizers will be at the door","visibility":"public"},{"created":1523063214000,"duration":28800000,"id":"249522041","name":"I/O Extended 2018 Vancouver","rsvp_limit":400,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1527955200000,"local_date":"2018-06-02","local_time":"09:00","updated":1527988348000,"utc_offset":-25200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":113,"venue":{"id":25033549,"name":"EventBase","lat":49.27436447143555,"lon":-123.12442016601562,"repinned":false,"address_1":"1280 Homer St","city":"Vancouver","country":"ca","localized_country_name":"Canada","zip":"","state":"BC"},"group":{"created":1497633678000,"name":"Google Developers Group - Cloud Vancouver","id":24502525,"join_mode":"open","lat":49.290000915527344,"lon":-123.12000274658203,"urlname":"GDGCloudVancouver","who":"Members","localized_location":"Vancouver, BC","state":"BC","country":"ca","region":"en_US","timezone":"Canada/Pacific"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDGCloudVancouver/events/249522041/","description":"<p>***************************************************************************<br/>You must sign up at <a href=\"https://www.picatic.com/event15261645244927\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.picatic.com/event15261645244927</a> to secure your spot at Google I/O extended event<br/>***************************************************************************</p> <p>This event will be a recap of what happened at this year's Google I/O, other activities, prizes, and more!</p> <p>I/O brings together developers from around the globe for talks, hands-on learning with Google experts, and the first look at Google’s latest developer products.</p> <p>This year at I/O, Google has unveiled incredible innovation in various parts of Google Technologies.

Do you feel like you are producing far more than you are being paid? Are you leaving money on the table?<br/>Negotiation is the most important tool in a woman’s toolbox, professionally and personally. Your career success depends on your ability to negotiate for yourself and for your organization. Negotiating a job offer is the most important conversation to the success of your career, yet only 12.5% of Women negotiate salary when offered a job. When women do negotiate, many ask for and expect 30% less than men.

And we often internalize messages that we aren’t good enough, and a sense of our failings can undercut our ability to accept our own achievements and successes.</p> <p>We have an excellent panel and a hands-on workshop planned for this evening. Do not miss out.</p> <p>EVERYONE IS WELCOME !!!</p> <p>Panelists:<br/>- Ruxandra Fediuc, Software Developer &amp; Architect at TELUS Digital,<br/>Director at Women Who Code Vancouver<br/>- Holly Peck, Research Scientist at Sanctuary.ai, Founder at Women Who Code<br/>- Monika Mascitti, Director, People at BuildDirect Technologies</p> <p>Workshop:<br/>Host:<br/>Antonia Issa, Client Education Manager at STAT Search Analytics<br/>Description:<br/>Over the course of 60 minutes, Antonia will take you through a journey that digs into the idea of confidence. We will start by finding the feeling. Rather than talking about it, you'll take a moment to locate it, and live it. From there, we will take a step back and look at the entire confidence spectrum. We'll then break down the blockers that prevent us from feeling confident. Finally we will identify real ways to develop confidence and maintain it, concluding the session with a set of tools that you can draw upon in future. The goal of the session is for you to leave energized, connected and ready to take action!</p> <p>Agenda:<br/>5.30 - 5.50pm : Sign in<br/>5.50 - 6.00pm : Welcome Note<br/>6.00 - 7.10pm : Panel Discussion<br/>7.10 - 7.30pm: Dinner and Networking break<br/>7.30 - 8.45pm: Workshop<br/>8.45 - 9.00pm: Closing Note</p> <p>Thanks to our Sponsors:<br/>Unbounce: Check out <a href=\"https://unbounce.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://unbounce.com/</a><br/>Clio : Check out <a href=\"https://www.clio.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.clio.com/</a><br/>Google for being our general sponsor.</p> <p>Women Techmakers:<br/>Google's Women Techmakers program provides visibility, community, and resources for women in technology.

The love of video games drew her towards software development. Convinced that she wasn't smart enough after graduation to be creating video games, she looked to other avenue to practice the skills she went to school for. Through her ten plus years in software development and specifically in web development, Kitty was met with many challenges that caused her to re-examine how she viewed her job, her responsibilities as a developer, and how she can make a positive impact on those around her. As of today, her goal in life is to find out how to propel the careers of her colleague, both from a technical and a non-technical point of view.</p> <p>Jennifer Fenech, Development Manager</p> <p>Jennifer is a Development Manager at Clio. She graduated in 2008 with a degree in Computer Science and AI from the University of Malta. During her time at University, she was teaching Software Engineering and Databases at the Malta College of Arts Science and Technology. In 2008, her team won a software design competition in the Microsoft Imagine Cup and had the opportunity to work as a research intern for Microsoft Research India. Following that, she has been working in the software industry since 2009 when she started working as a software developer. She has over 10 years of development experience and has moved to a people management role in the past 2 years. She has recently moved to Canada from Malta and one of her current objectives is to work on improving her management skills to be able to build empowered and high-performing teams.</p> <p>Maria Kim, Senior Software Engineer.</p> <p>Maria Kim is a Senior Software Developer at Clio, with over a decade of experience as a software engineer. Maria originally hails from the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan area, where she received a B.S. in Computer Science and M.S. in Computer Systems Management from the University of Maryland. She loves a good challenge and has worked on multi-million dollar satellite operations management contracts, automated chart generation for the aviation industry, as well as a variety of internal research and development projects throughout her career. She is excited to join the Clio team in its mission to “change the practice of law for good”. She and her husband reside in beautiful Vancouver, BC where they love to take their brand new Vespa out on rides.<br/>###</p> <p>GETTING HERE:</p> <p>Clio is located in Burnaby, near BCIT.

Don't worry! Google Developer Group Cloud Vancouver will bring you the event for you.</p> <p>Cloud Next '19 is the biggest Google Cloud Platform event that happens annually in San Francisco. It brings the world's most innovative and technologically advanced people for a chance to be apart of lectures and workshops.</p> <p>The primary content of this event will be a talk from the great Vikram Tiwari and Martin Omander.</p> <p>❓About Vikram❓<br/>Vikram builds scalable web and data platforms for high availability, resilience, and security. Co-founder, Omni Labs Inc Google Developer Expert for Google Cloud and Machine Learning.</p> <p>❓About Martin❓<br/>Martin Omander works for Google in Mountain View, California. His job in the Developer Relations team is to help developers build better software, and improve Google's Cloud Platform to make it even better for that purpose. Before Google, Martin worked at a string of startups in Silicon Valley as a software engineer. In his spare time, he is an amateur game programmer.</p> <p>Talk Title:<br/>📌Things I Wish I Knew Before Building Serverless ML Solutions📌</p> <p>Building ML models for a proof-of-concept app is easy. To deploy them in a production system is hard. It becomes even more challenging when you have to keep your models fresh by retraining them every day. These challenges are faced by every team working on deploying their ML solutions. The session will demonstrate how Omni Labs is doing this process in a serverless manner. After the talk, you should be able to reason about your ML models and architect serverless ML pipelines.</p> <p>📌Migrating from a Monolith to Microservices📌</p> <p>Microservices enable development teams to be more agile, but it’s hard to break up an existing monolithic application or to run many services. Come to see a time-lapse refactoring of a fictional monolithic web application into decoupled services. An incremental approach and GCP serverless products for hosting, communication, and storage come to the rescue. We will explore how to get started and use best practices for your journey to a low-ops, high-velocity future.</p> <p>💼Agenda💼<br/>=============<br/>5:30 - 6:00 Sign in, Pizza &amp; Social time<br/>6:00 - 6:15 Quick Intro to GDG Cloud Vancouver<br/>6:15 - 7:15 Things I Wish I Knew Before Building Serverless ML Solutions<br/>7:20 - 8:20 Migrating from a Monolith to Microservices<br/>8:10 - 9:00 Social time</p> <p>🙏Special thanks to CodeCore for providing us with a venue🙏<br/>=============================================================<br/>CodeCore Developer Bootcamp is a 12-week intensive training program for Web Software Development with a focus on Node.js, Express, Ruby on Rails, React, Javascript, and more.
