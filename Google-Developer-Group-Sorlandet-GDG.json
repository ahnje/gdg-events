Taking your web app offline (in a good sense)<br/>Speaker: Maxim Salnikov - Microsoft<br/>Description:<br/>Web as an application platform is amazing: evergreen browsers or some form of web views exist almost on every device with UI, we have native APIs to access the hardware, we use versatile language with the excellent tooling, we are the huge (the largest ever) developer community after all! But the web historically tightly coupled with the connection state... In my session, we confirm: the modern web APIs and some best practices allow us to build offline-first web apps: always available, caring about data consumption, preserving and sync, providing UX which is comparable (if not better) to the native apps, regardless of the connection. Plus, the current state of the tooling makes it possible to add these features in a fast and reliable way. Let's explore the offline web in a very practical manner - by building the offline-first app!</p> <p>This session will be useful for web front-end developers who have heard about progressive web apps (who haven't :), maybe even tired of PWA-hype, and thus want to understand some of UX benefits on practice. As this is not another \"What is PWA\" session, I focus exclusively on the modern APIs making offline-first approach possible, in a form of task+solution sections - to maximize the usefulness.</p> <p>Backend developers and mobile developers will get a nice overview of what web can do today (they will be impressed).</p> <p>2. Make your app installable<br/>Speaker: Laura Morinigo - Samsung Internet<br/>Description:<br/>A progressive web app is a way to bring a native-app experience into the browser. One of the main features is the ability to make your app installable on different platforms like desktop and smartphones. During this talk, we are going to review what we need to make our app installable, the best practices and standards that we have to follow in order to bring a good user experience, trends and a reference to the manifest file.</p> <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>About our speakers:</p> <p>Maxim Salnikov:</p> <p>This time we are so lucky to be joined by Maxim Salnikov from Microsoft.<br/>Maxim Salnikov is an Oslo-based cloud and web front-end geek with a strong passion for the developer community building.
