Taking your web app offline (in a good sense)<br/>Speaker: Maxim Salnikov - Microsoft<br/>Description:<br/>Web as an application platform is amazing: evergreen browsers or some form of web views exist almost on every device with UI, we have native APIs to access the hardware, we use versatile language with the excellent tooling, we are the huge (the largest ever) developer community after all! But the web historically tightly coupled with the connection state... In my session, we confirm: the modern web APIs and some best practices allow us to build offline-first web apps: always available, caring about data consumption, preserving and sync, providing UX which is comparable (if not better) to the native apps, regardless of the connection. Plus, the current state of the tooling makes it possible to add these features in a fast and reliable way. Let's explore the offline web in a very practical manner - by building the offline-first app!</p> <p>This session will be useful for web front-end developers who have heard about progressive web apps (who haven't :), maybe even tired of PWA-hype, and thus want to understand some of UX benefits on practice. As this is not another \"What is PWA\" session, I focus exclusively on the modern APIs making offline-first approach possible, in a form of task+solution sections - to maximize the usefulness.</p> <p>Backend developers and mobile developers will get a nice overview of what web can do today (they will be impressed).</p> <p>2. Make your app installable<br/>Speaker: Laura Morinigo - Samsung Internet<br/>Description:<br/>A progressive web app is a way to bring a native-app experience into the browser. One of the main features is the ability to make your app installable on different platforms like desktop and smartphones. During this talk, we are going to review what we need to make our app installable, the best practices and standards that we have to follow in order to bring a good user experience, trends and a reference to the manifest file.</p> <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>About our speakers:</p> <p>Maxim Salnikov:</p> <p>This time we are so lucky to be joined by Maxim Salnikov from Microsoft.<br/>Maxim Salnikov is an Oslo-based cloud and web front-end geek with a strong passion for the developer community building. He architects and builds complex web applications since the end of the last century, and has extensive experience with all aspects of web platform focusing on the apps managing real-time data from IoT devices, and Progressive Web Apps. He is a Google Developer Expert in Web Technologies &amp; IoT, and a former Microsoft MVP in Development Technologies.</p> <p>Maxim is a founder and active contributor to two conferences: Mobile Era and ngVikings - Nordics’ main conferences for mobile and Angular developers respectively.

However, Ivy has much more to offer, and many smart concepts provide the foundation for some much-anticipated future features.</p> <p>Find out how Ivy's potential can impact your future architecture. We use a case study to explore a possible future without NgModules but Standalone Components, the use of dynamic components or higher-order components, zone-less change detection, and new possibilities for lazy loading and plug-in systems.</p> <p>In the end, you understand Ivy's potential and how to start preparing for it today.</p> <p>------------------------</p> <p>Title: TBD by Fabriece Sumuni<br/>Abstract: TBD</p> <p>------------------------</p> <p>Title: Angular Elements for Authentication: The what, the how and the why by Ana Cidre</p> <p>Abstract:<br/>In this talk, we will take a look at what Angular Elements are, what they consist of and how to build them. Then we will see what advantages Web Components have when approaching and implementing authentication into our application, how Web Components can facilitate the implementation of authentication and share some examples of which Web Components we can create to simplify the process. We will also talk about what options we have today to build Web Components, which frameworks support them and whether browsers are ready for them.</p> <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Our Speakers' biography:</p> <p>Manfred Steyer:<br/>Trainer, consultant and programming architect with a focus on Angular.

It takes discipline to use container technology. It may not be as secure nor as optimal as you thought it would be. Although it’s relatively easy to create a new immutable container image to run everywhere, you may have fallen into many of the caveats. Is it running as the root user? Why are the images taking so much space? Why did your containers run out of space in the first place!? Most importantly, your container images may not be as immutable nor repeatable as you thought, and your Java process might be overutilizing assigned resources! Attend this session to learn how to best address these issues when building your Java container images.</p> <p>**Speaker:**<br/>Ray Tsang<br/>Ray is a Developer Advocate for the Google Cloud Platform and a Java Champion.

For sure it's a good question. What should you do if you have to execute some code on a native platform? We'll find it out with the magic of platform channels. How do they work, limitations, performance, and many more.</p> <p>Title: Convenient internationalization of Flutter apps by Dominik Roszkowski<br/>Abstract: Flutter provides a set of useful APIs that enable you to support multiple languages out of the box. Hot-reload and hot-restart let you continuously update your language resources and see changes live. There is, however, a small problem. Flutter uses arb files by default and not many translation services support this. How to overcome this? How to do it efficiently and not spend minutes or hours manually editing arb files? In this talk, you'll learn the fundamentals of internationalization in Flutter. You'll see how to quickly and safely add i18n to your Flutter app and combine this with several translation providers.<br/>Bio: Dominik is a freelance mobile developer experienced in Flutter and other cross-platform technologies.

Bloc vs Redux by Aleksandr Denisov<br/>Abstract: Flutter is a framework from Google, created for the multiplatform application development. It's possible to build apps for iOS, Android, Web, and Desktop with the same codebase.<br/>Unfortunately, there is not a lot of information in the documentation that looks like a guide to the recommended application architecture.<br/>This talk will be about various typical architectures that can be used when developing on Flutter their pros, and cons, and in more detail, about two of them - BloC and Redux.</p> <p>Session abstracts:<br/>- a declarative UI, how it differs from an imperative UI and what is State Management;<br/>- different architectural approaches in Flutter, their evolution, the pros and cons of each in general terms;<br/>- analysis of Redux and BLoC with a detailed comparison and code examples from speaker's applications;</p> <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>About our Speakers:</p> <p>Aleksandr Denisov<br/>Aleksandr is an experienced specialist in enterprise development and in IT for more than 15 years.

This is possible because infrastructure has become abstracted from physical hardware., meaning it can be treated like a software system. That means you can apply Version control, Test-Driven Development, Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery to your infrastructure.</p> <p>Terraform<br/>Terraform is used to create, manage, and update infrastructure resources such as physical machines, VMs, network switches, containers, and more. Almost any infrastructure type can be represented as a resource in Terraform such as IaaS (e.g. AWS, GCP, Microsoft Azure, OpenStack), PaaS (e.g. Heroku), or even SaaS services.</p> <p>Pulumi<br/>Pulumi is a multi-language and multi-cloud development platform. It lets you create all aspects of your cloud as code in many known programming languages. This has many advantages like a familiar DSL and gives the possibility to build abstractions with the full power of the language you choose. In this talk, I will give you a quick overview of what Pulumi is and how it is different from other tools.</p> <p>**Speakers:**<br/>Talk will be held by Hans Kristian Flaatten and Øyvind Randa.</p> <p>Hans Kristian Flaatten is an experienced Site Reliability Engineering Team Lead.
