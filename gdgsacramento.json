Unlike current platforms, tCubed-enabled apps encourage users to interact face-to-face with friends and family. Best of all, developers can use any operating system to control tCubed using over Bluetooth using our API. </p> <p><b>Cloud Vision API</b></p> <p>Earlier this year Google announced their Cloud Vision API - the technology that powers their image search, Google Photos, and various other products. It is now open to developers to utilize in their own projects. Do you want to build your personal photo album website and have it recognize your friends?

This talk argues that all team members - from engineers to product managers - should take an active role in the UX process. Together, we'll unpack what it means for a product to have \"good UX\" and learn how to achieve it, with or without a UX team.</p> <p>The talk will begin by outlining the main phases of the UX process. For each phase, we'll deep dive into key questions to ask and techniques used to answer them. We'll end by tackling 5 barriers that engineering colleagues say deter them from getting involved in the UX process.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Jennifer is a designer at Google. She believes that successful design influences business strategy (by equipping teams with human centered approaches to problem-solving). In her current role leading YouTube’s Content ID UX team, Jennifer helps YouTube Creators and companies protect and profit off of their content. Prior to Google, she designed for financial and advertising agencies across New York, Boston, London, and Bangalore.</p> <p>TALK #2:<br/>Progressive Web Apps are the future (Alain Chautard - Angular GDE)</p> <p>Alain will introduce what Progressive Web Apps are all about, and explain why they are the future for web / mobile development. In this talk, we will see how progressive web apps can allow us to write our web application code once, and use it on any platform with a native behavior. We will see that the very same HTML / Javascript code can now behave like a native Android or IOS application by implementing the Progressive Web App pattern, which is about to become a W3C standard. We're going to see actual examples of progressive web apps, as well as dive into the different standards involved in making progressive web apps a reality, such as service worker, web app manifest, and notifications.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Alain is a Google Developer Expert in Web Technologies / Angular.

(Amber Vanderburg)</p> <p>In this chat, Amber will outline how we can bring the Agile mindset to places such as HR, finance, and marketing. This chat will provide new insights into how we can use Agile methods to transform our organizations.</p> <p>Talk - Flutter for Android Developers (Denis Neklyudov)</p> <p>Flutter became very popular among Android devs after release. But developers have many questions. With a new framework and programming language, they lost tools and approaches that they familiar with. No Retrofit, Room, Realm, DataBinding, RxJava and what architecture is the best for Flutter apps? This talk is addressed to answer Android developers questions to help them to enjoy creating production-ready mobile apps.</p> <p>Talk - Analyzing Twitter Data for Disaster Response (Avolyn Fisher)</p> <p>Talk - Embedded Platforms: Lessons from Google &amp; Partners (Jeremy Glassenberg)</p> <p>As popular web services extend their developer platforms for partners to integrate directly into their interfaces, design trends are forming from experiences in the world of embedded integrations. With Google Drive connecting tools like Balsamiq and ShiftEdit, Gmail enabling Docusign in their web and mobile UI, and Trello’s PowerUps, custom experiences powered by third parties are proving themselves to be a great way to improve one’s product and grow your business.</p> <p>Talk - How to Change Career Paths in Tech (Milecia McGregor)</p> <p>Staying in a field you aren’t passionate about makes it hard to go to work. When you know you want to stay in tech, but your current position is driving you crazy it’s time to make some decisions. There are so many different roles you can do in the tech industry like, database administration, mobile app development, DevOps, front-end development, etc. You just have to pick one and commit to learning about it.</p> <p>Workshop - You Too Can Be A Sketching Machine! (Rizwan Javaid)</p> <p>Sketching is a crucial skill that spans all job titles. It helps with brainstorming ideas, iterating through concepts, and communicating our ideas to others. Whether working individually or in a group, our ability to sketch helps take the abstract ideas out of heads and into the real world. If you’re not comfortable sketching then there is little chance that your ideas will stick with you, your team members, and even your clients. Come prepared to do a fun, challenging, and inspiring sketching exercises so you can experience the power of sketching firsthand.</p> <p>Talk - Using Machine Learning To Improve UI/UX (Milecia McGregor)</p> <p>In this talk, attendees will learn some background on machine learning and algorithms and see examples of where TensorFlow.js can be used in real applications. We’ll cover business cases in web development where machine learning can help, how neural networks work, and how JavaScript can be used to train a model and make real-time updates for users. By the end of the talk, attendees should have a good understanding of basic machine learning concepts and an idea of how they could get started with TensorFlow.js.</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false}],"organizers":[{"id":62116972,"name":"Michael","status":"active","joined":1347470183000,"city":"Chico","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","state":"CA","lat":39.79,"lon":-121.85,"photo":{"id":250516745,"highres_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/4/1/6/9/highres_250516745.jpeg","photo_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/4/1/6/9/member_250516745.jpeg","thumb_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/4/1/6/9/thumb_250516745.jpeg","type":"member","base_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com"},"group_profile":{"status":"active","visited":1564067767000,"created":1494868849000,"updated":1553277163000,"role":"coorganizer","group":{"id":1623056,"urlname":"gdgsacramento","name":"Google Developer Group (GDG) Sacramento","status":"active","who":"Members","members":1777,"join_mode":"open","localized_location":"Sacramento, CA","group_photo":{"id":483038715,"highres_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/7/3/b/highres_483038715.jpeg","photo_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/7/3/b/600_483038715.jpeg","thumb_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/7/3/b/thumb_483038715.jpeg","type":"event","base_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com"}},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdgsacramento/members/62116972/"},"is_pro_admin":false},{"id":157212072,"name":"Alain C.","bio":"I help web development teams learn and become fluent with Angular.
