Just a few<br/>development iterations are enough to totally mess up your color<br/>palette or your icon sets.</p> <p>Consistency gets even trickier if you have to ensure it across<br/>different Android apps. In such a scenario, defining style guides<br/>becomes crucial. Assets, icons, colors, metrics, and components should<br/>be easily accessible by developers/designers across your teams.<br/>Furthermore, you must ensure that every style guide change will not<br/>break your app.</p> <p>Yelp ships its experience across Android, iOS and Web apps used by<br/>millions of users. In this talk, you will get an insight into the<br/>challenges we face on a daily basis ensuring our visual consistency,<br/>and the solutions we adopted.</p> <p>## About Nicola Corti:</p> <p>Nicola Corti is Android Software Engineer since 2.2, Free and Open<br/>Source lover since he remembers. Currently working as an Android<br/>Engineer @ Yelp Inc, connecting millions of users with great local<br/>businesses worldwide.<br/>He usually calls himself a \"community addicted\", can't survive without<br/>learning every day, sharing knowledge and having fun with other<br/>developers.
