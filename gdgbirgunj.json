Through these, participants learn about the value of open data as evidence for decision making and innovation. The Data Expedition involves participants teaming up to find data related to their local community, learning skills in accessing and understanding data from various sources, and developing ideas for open data-based solutions to local problems (such as datasets, maps, blogs, infographics, technical applications etc). </p> <p>OKN believes the outputs will show exciting information about development issues in Dang, and provide a starting point for participants to further engage with data to address development issues in their community.
