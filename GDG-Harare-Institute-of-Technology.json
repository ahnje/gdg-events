High school teams of five will be mentored by a developer representing a team of three whilst the teachers will moderate the discussions. This team will identify a problem and come up with an implentable solution and design a storyboard for it.</p> <p>The developer teams will now implement these solutions into prototypes.<br/>Meanwhile, a panel of judges and congress of corporates engage in GCP Internet of Things Codelabs amongst discussions. At day end of the 23rd of March, the teams will present their prototypes to this audience and winners are determined. The teams should take note of the feedback they receive on pitching and use it to perfect their ideas until June where the 8 participants of each team are to all pitch their finished products to companies that may be willing to invest in them.</p> <p>We urge all developers to form teams and get a chance to be mentored into seeing their dreams to life. Corporates, we appeal to you to support our budding developers as you also enhance your career by adding accreditation of the Cloud Platform from Google's Qwiklabs!</p> <p>See you all there!</p> ","how_to_find_us":"Automotive Hall","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1558088003000,"duration":10800000,"id":"261539582","name":"Google I/O Extended","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1559318400000,"local_date":"2019-05-31","local_time":"18:00","updated":1559332430000,"utc_offset":7200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":20,"venue":{"id":25360458,"name":"B2C Coworking","lat":-17.830759048461914,"lon":31.049882888793945,"repinned":false,"address_1":"Cnr Jason Moyo Ave and First Street, Harare, Zimbabwe","city":"Harare","country":"zw","localized_country_name":"Zimbabwe","phone":"+263785768212"},"group":{"created":1493015742000,"name":"Developer Student Club HIT","id":23400446,"join_mode":"open","lat":-17.81999969482422,"lon":31.049999237060547,"urlname":"GDG-Harare-Institute-of-Technology","who":"Members","localized_location":"Harare, Zimbabwe","state":"","country":"zw","region":"en_US","timezone":"Africa/Harare"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Harare-Institute-of-Technology/events/261539582/","description":"<p>Welcome to Google I/O Extended 2019 for our DSC Chapter!
