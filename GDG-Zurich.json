Asking questions, unpacking assumptions and trying to get to the bottom of things are some of her favourite activities - supported by methodologies all the cool kids are using, such as Lean, Agile and Design Thinking. She's a passionate advocate for improving diversity in technology and ensuring our workplaces are welcoming and inclusive. Also: cats rule, dogs drool.</p> <p>How to become a UX designer in (50) 30 minutes<br/>_____________________________________________________________________</p> <p>Many people believe that UX designers are a rare species, descended from unicorns, who create their designs in magical clearings in the forest during full moon. Well, this is obviously not the case. Proper UX Design follows a clear and rational process. This talk is for UX unicorn believers, developers or designers who work with developers and it aims to demystify a user centered UX process by showing a practical and rational UX process from start to finish.</p> <p>Machine Learning for Designers<br/>_____________________________________________________________________</p> <p>Artificial Intelligence sits at the core of the biggest transformation of our industry: the convergence of Industrial Design, Interaction Design and Service Design forming a new mega-discipline. With it comes the need for designers to evolve into new fields, one of which is Machine Learning.<br/>This talk is about what Machine Learning is, how it is driving the change in our industry, and what of it is important for designers.</p> <p>Memi is an experience designer with more backgrounds than a Wes Anderson movie. He's a college dropout (English Literature &amp; Linguistics) and a trained film director. He's been writing code since he was 13, with absolutely no ambition other than to see what happens. This ambition got him to the field of UX where he enjoys finding out what people need, building it and having a good cry after testing.<br/>He is curious and if you give him a stick and a bear, he'll know what to do. He's not good at sports, so you might reconsider.</p> <p>More talks will be announced soon.</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1519298359000,"duration":7200000,"id":"pqldkpyxlbmb","name":"GDG & WTM Stammtisch","rsvp_limit":15,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1533834000000,"local_date":"2018-08-09","local_time":"19:00","updated":1533847770000,"utc_offset":7200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":7,"venue":{"id":21708272,"name":"Cafe Henrici","lat":47.3726806640625,"lon":8.543609619140625,"repinned":false,"address_1":"Niederdorfstrasse 1","city":"Zürich","country":"ch","localized_country_name":"Switzerland"},"group":{"created":1384363827000,"name":"GDG Zürich","id":11090922,"join_mode":"open","lat":47.380001068115234,"lon":8.539999961853027,"urlname":"GDG-Zurich","who":"Developers","localized_location":"Zürich, Switzerland","state":"","country":"ch","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Zurich"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Zurich/events/pqldkpyxlbmb/","description":"<p>• What we'll do<br/>Meeting interesting people, talk about tech, socialise, network or whatever floats your boat ;-)</p> <p>• Important to know<br/>This is an event hosted by GDG (Google developer group), as well as WTM (Women Techmakers) and aims at bringing people together and foster a diverse environment.

So, what about making our solutions smarter without any knowledge in AI? In this session, we’ll see how to transform or extract information from text, image, audio &amp; video with the latest ML APIs, how to train an AutoML custom model, and we’ll be active players of a live demo.

He works for Google where he ecstatically explores cloud technologies. In a previous life, he pioneered the ebook industry, co-created the first European ebook reader, and co-founded Bookeen. He now enjoys sharing his passion in international conferences.

How many Android devices can update to the newest OS version after 2 years? In case you are a mobile developer, how it feels supporting different OS versions that can behave completely different? How many times have you wished to use any language as a first-class citizen for mobile development? In this talk we will show how Fuchsia addresses the former problems with its modular design and its new kernel created from scratch (no Linux here); its use of AI; and its UI SDK, based on Flutter, which also lets you reuse the app for Android and iOS (and other desktop OS and the web in the near future). But it doesn't stop here, and Fuchsia will be the OS for any kind of device, from IoT devices to the Cloud.</p> <p>19.00 - 19.45 - New kid in the BLoC, Filipe A. Barroso. The goal of this talk is that the end of 40 minutes you will have a better understanding of state management in Flutter, through BLoC, InheritedWidget &amp; Scoped model, Redux, and less known MobX. So that in your next Flutter project you will have better confidence in why you pick one and not the other.</p> <p>19.45 - 20.30 - The sharp Corners of BLoC, Katarina Sheremet.</p> <p>20.30 - 21.00 -
