While this hasn't been an issue in the past since most Java files are hidden on the server, it is an issue on Android phones where the client side Android apk files are easily obtained and just as easy to decompile back into source.</p> <p>In this talk Godfrey Nolan, author of Decompiling Java, and the soon to be published Decompiling Android will explain how and why this is possible by unraveling the apk into classes.dex files using the tools that are currently available to decompile your apk's back into Java or HTML5/CSS source code with the right click of a mouse. We'll show some of the security issues that this raises, such as inadvertently allowing people gain access to credit card information or backend systems, when someone has complete access to your source. We'll also look at open source and commercial obfuscation tools and other techniques you should be using, such as C++ coding using the NDK, to stop people gaining access to your Android code.</p> <p>Speaker Bio:<br/>Godfrey Nolan is founder and president of RIIS a mobile development firm in the Detroit Metro area. He is also author of Decompiling Java (Apress) and the soon to be published Decompiling Android. Godfrey has spoken as AnDevCon, JavaOne, ASP-Connections, VSLive, Codemash, Code PaLOUsa, 1DevDay and many local Java and .Net user groups on a wide range of topics such as Continuous Integration, Executable Requirements and mobile security.</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1343050600000,"id":"74517962","name":"Google I/O Android Recap","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1343341800000,"local_date":"2012-07-26","local_time":"18:30","updated":1343428035000,"utc_offset":-14400000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":26,"venue":{"id":7815632,"name":"Arbormoon Software, Inc","lat":42.27996063232422,"lon":-83.74732208251953,"repinned":false,"address_1":"212 S.

He enjoys keeping up on technology and finding ways to integrate it with daily life.</p> <p><b><br/></b></p> <p><b>Supporting Synchronous Collaboration in Mobile Apps: Use Collabrify.IT’s SDK to Collabrify YOUR App!</b></p> <p>Starting out in the K-12 space, we built an SDK to collabrify – enable mobile apps on iOS and Android to support the simultaneous use by two or more individuals who need not be co-located – educational apps such as concept mapping, KWL charting, drawing/animation, writing, etc. We have now generalized the SDK, started Collabrify.IT, Inc., and are looking to license the Collabrify SDK to iOS and Android mobile app developers.</p> <p>In our presentation, we will demo a collabrified app (WeList, a collabrified list making app), describe the architecture of the underlying collabrification system, and show code snippets for how to actually collabrify an app. Our primary intent in giving this presentation isn’t sales, but rather we are looking for feedback from developers on our collabrification technique/architecture.</p> <p>Presenting will be Elliot Soloway, CEO and UMich Professor, Kevin Crosby, Josh Lin (RPM Associate), Vidal Borromeo, Josh Meyer, Adrian Prayogo.</p> <p>For more information visit: <a href=\"http://collabrify.it/\"><a href=\"http://collabrify.it/\" class=\"linkified\">http://collabrify.it/</a></a>  and <a href=\"http://www.intergalacticmlc.org/\"><a href=\"http://www.intergalacticmlc.org/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.intergalacticmlc.org/</a></a> or contact <a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]</a>  For pictures of the presenters see: <a href=\"http://collabrify.it/about/\"><a href=\"http://collabrify.it/about/\" class=\"linkified\">http://collabrify.it/about/</a></a></p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1398347736000,"duration":28800000,"id":"178994312","name":"The Michigan Google Developers DevFest 2014","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1400329800000,"local_date":"2014-05-17","local_time":"08:30","updated":1400497237000,"utc_offset":-14400000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":19,"venue":{"id":19728032,"name":"Quicken Loans Qube Building","lat":42.330387115478516,"lon":-83.04615783691406,"repinned":false,"address_1":"635 Woodward Ave","city":"Detroit","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"","state":"MI"},"group":{"created":1340205693000,"name":"GDG Ann Arbor","id":4127542,"join_mode":"open","lat":42.2599983215332,"lon":-83.72000122070312,"urlname":"gdg-a2","who":"Developers","localized_location":"Ann Arbor, MI","state":"MI","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Eastern"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdg-a2/events/178994312/","description":"<p>The Detroit and Ann Arbor Chapters of the Google Developers Group (GDG) are hosting a one day Google DevFest in Downtown Detroit.

Our main meeting will start at 7pm. Topic: Dead Simple Push Messaging with Parse.com presented by Scott Weber.</p> <p>Push messaging can seem a bit overwhelming at first glance. You have to build out a server component, gather a bunch of keys, create a receiver, register with Google, and then hope (fingers crossed!) that you got all the moving parts hooked together in the right way and that push message shows up on your device.</p> <p>Parse.com to the rescue! Using the free tools from Parse.com, you can get up and running with push messaging in your app in a matter of minutes. A couple of clicks on a website, a few lines of code and you're off and running.</p> <p>In this presentation, we will build a brand new app, enable push messaging via Parse.com, and successfully deliver push messages to that app. Feel free to bring your laptop and follow along to push-enable your own app, if you like!</p> <p>---------------</p> <p>Scott Weber is an Android developer at Expedia in Ann Arbor.</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1429751448000,"id":"222034512","name":"Adaptive Android Design Practice","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1430433000000,"local_date":"2015-04-30","local_time":"18:30","updated":1430454202000,"utc_offset":-14400000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":23,"venue":{"id":17935472,"name":"Arbormoon Software, Inc","lat":42.282135009765625,"lon":-83.75020599365234,"repinned":false,"address_1":"123 N Ashley, Suite 9","city":"Ann Arbor","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"","state":"MI"},"group":{"created":1340205693000,"name":"GDG Ann Arbor","id":4127542,"join_mode":"open","lat":42.2599983215332,"lon":-83.72000122070312,"urlname":"gdg-a2","who":"Developers","localized_location":"Ann Arbor, MI","state":"MI","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Eastern"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdg-a2/events/222034512/","description":"<p>Starting at 6:30pm, we'll have free food sponsored by Arbormoon Software, Inc.

In truth, animations actually exist to improve an app's user experience. Animations help users understand state changes, guide them to notice meaningful information, gather focus to a required action, or express relationships between UI elements. This session examines traditional techniques using property and drawable animations, as well as the new MotionLayout introduced at Google I/O 2018. These techniques can expand content, display state, move elements, and highlight important controls. Properly executed animation effects are applicable to buttons, lists, and images in any Android app, taking an app's user experience from good to great.</p> <p>A long time resident of metro Detroit, Dr. Truxall has been slinging code for a living since 1995, working with enterprise web technologies, modeling business processes, and building public web sites and mobile apps for some of the largest companies in North America.
