Retrofit from Square is an Android networking library that takes a lot of pain out of networking code. During the talk we’ll examine Retrofit in-depth and discuss its benefits. We’ll also discuss areas it could improve.</p> <p>Continuous integration is vital to creating and testing reliable applications. Antoine Campbell will demonstrate an end to end build server using Jenkins.
