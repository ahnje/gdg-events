The algorithm is described with principles of artificial neural networks. It is perfect for analysis of multidimensional data structures and ideal as the first step into Data Mining. Building your own Self-organizing map will help you to understand the principle of this method in detail and experience how parameters influence the result.

Алгоритм выражен в терминах искусственных нейронных сетей. Алгоритм не является \"серебряной пулей\", но прекрасно подходит для первичного изучения скрытых структур исследуемых многомерных данных. Также идеален для первого шага в мир Data Mining. Собственная реализация метода Вам поможет в деталях понять принцип работы метода и прочувствовать влияние параметров на результат. Для разработки сети и выполнения экспериментов, используется VBA (EXCEL). Это позволяет задействовать весь потенциал построения графиков, простых пользовательских форм, ввода и вывода данных.

Knowing HTML, CSS is a big plus but not obligatory.<br/>At this workshop you will learn not only JavaScript-specific things but also concepts present in other programming languages. So even if you decided to learn PHP or C++ in future but don’t know any basics, this JS workshop still can be valuable to you!</p> <p>Here’s what we’ll learn:<br/>📌 What is JavaScript (JS). Where you can write it and use it.<br/>📌 Variables<br/>📌 Basic operations with variables (arithmetic, boolean)<br/>📌 Conditionals<br/>📌 Functions<br/>📌 Loops<br/>📌 DOM API<br/>📌 Accessing webpage through code<br/>📌 A bit of HTML and CSS</p> <p>We will code something interesting together! There are prepared tasks with ready HTML and CSS, to which we will add some interactivity with JS and will see what happens.</p> <p>Language: mostly English, but our mentors can explain everything in Latvian or Russian :)</p> <p>👩🏻‍💻The workshop will be led by front end developer Alina Karpeļceva.<br/>🍕we will have light lunch on spot sponsored by supporters<br/>💻This workshop is free for everyone, but ladies are especially invited!</p> <p>It is organized by GDG Daugavpils and supported by United States Embassy - Riga, Latvia LIAA Daugavpils biznesa inkubators and Riga TechGirls</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1528976907000,"duration":14400000,"id":"251751601","name":"Daugavpils Developers meetup","rsvp_limit":15,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1530957600000,"local_date":"2018-07-07","local_time":"13:00","updated":1530975888000,"utc_offset":10800000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":4,"group":{"created":1495094839000,"name":"GDG Daugavpils","id":23838726,"join_mode":"open","lat":55.880001068115234,"lon":26.510000228881836,"urlname":"GDG-Daugavpils","who":"Members","localized_location":"Daugavpils, Latvia","state":"","country":"lv","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Riga"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Daugavpils/events/251751601/","description":"<p>The mission of Daugavpils Developer meetup is to serve the needs of local developer community providing space for knowledge sharing, learning, teaching and networking.
