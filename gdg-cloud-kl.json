Knative provides a better choice. Knative extends Kubernetes to provide a set of middleware components (build, serving, events) for modern, source-centric, and container-based apps that can run anywhere. In this talk, we’ll see how we can use Knative primitives to build a serverless app that utilizes the Machine Learning magic of the cloud.</p> <p>Ng Tong Sheng &amp; Faz<br/>Title: Code, Build, Run, and Observe with Google Cloud<br/>Talk: Google Cloud is enabling developers to focus on their code by providing better tools and infrastructure for their backend services. See how Google Cloud make it easy to code, build, run, and observe your applications and services with Google Cloud with an emphasis on Serverless.
