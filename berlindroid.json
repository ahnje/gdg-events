Simple code snippets will be used to explain MVVM implementation and testing and showcase the advantages over MVP. Engineering war stories along with our lessons learned will be shared so you can avoid the mistakes we have made. I will also give you our answer for: is Rx a remedy for all ills and difficulties in every codebase or can the medicine have unforeseen adverse effects?\"</i></p> <p>Instead of a second presentation, we'd like to get a discussion going about the hottest new Android-related things announced at Google I/O.

Then we will briefly compare with the other alternative solutions. Lastly, we will see how easy it is to connect Google’s Firebase infrastructure to have cloud connected devices.</i></p> <p>Like always, there will be plenty of time for socializing.

This month we'll have the following two presentations:</p> <p>Miriam Busch, Muhammed Salih Güler, Álvaro Santisteban Diéguez: <b>Improving development skills with Udacity's Android Nanodegrees – A team's review</b></p> <p><i>Udacity and Google collaborated to create two online courses for Android developers: \"Android Basics\" and \"Android Developer\". We will share our experiences taking these classes from the points of view of a junior developer, an intermediate developer, a senior developer and their manager.<br/></i></p> <p>Stefan Medack: <b>Data Classes and parsing JSON – A Story about converting Models to Kotlin </b></p> <p><i>Since the announcement of official Kotlin support at Google I/O we can be sure that Kotlin is here to stay and you can already feel the boost this language is getting. At Kitchen Stories we love this uprise and we are migrating our code base gradually to leverage the new features this language provides us.<br/></i><i>In this session, I want to take you along the journey on how and why we migrated all our POJOs to POKOs. You will learn how Kotlins data classes, constructor default values and non-nullability can enable a more robust JSON parsing and how you can improve parsing with Moshi.</i></p> <p>And of course there will be plenty of time to chat and enjoy a cold beverage or two.</p> <p>You may also be interested to know that <a href=\"https://2017.devfest-berlin.de/\">DevFest Berlin</a> is right around the corner.

I did, many times! Fragments are not easy to use, and many experts even recommend to avoid them. But what is the alternative? We tried Conductor, we liked it and I am going to show you what can you do with it.</p> <p>----------------------------------</p> <p>2017 for Androids in Berlin<br/>by Hasan Hosgel</p> <p>Let us recap on the awesomeness that 2017 was.</p> <p>----------------------------------</p> <p>🏴‍☠️ ARrrrg! The Google AR Android Demo Application deciphered. 🏴‍☠️<br/>by Mario Bodemann</p> <p>This was my first reaction reading through the code of the sample provided by Google for it's new ARCore. After the first shock, I took a close look on how the app works, and what ARCore could do for my use case: Having my virtual collection of toy figures always with me ❤️. 🤖🤴</p> <p>----------------------------------</p> <p>In between the talks we have plenty of awesome time to talk to other Android developers, give feedback on talks and enjoy a drink or two from the bar. Additionally we will have the `flea market` section, where you can present your quick ideas/joboffers/questions to our audience. Think of it as you personal open microphone night, without too much singing.</p> <p>Awesome for you to join and read this far.

The ‘first act’ is platform independent, focusing on Unix’s workings, from syscalls to environment variables – serving both Linux, Mac, iOS and Android fans.<br/>Then, we’ll focus a bit on Android – the history of the platform and its relation to native code loading, plus even diving into Android’s source code!\"</p> <p>There will be food and drinks.

You will get to learn about the common pitfalls and how to overcome them by using the right approach such as leveraging architecture components and making your android libraries lifecycle aware. We will also be covering how one can leverage the Kotlin language when developing android libraries as well as information around API design and exploring the path to becoming a better Android Library Developer.</p> <p>By the end of this session, you will be all set to build android libraries that scale and have API which contributes to developer happiness.\"</p> <p>Our second talk is \"The Art of Code Reviews\" by Fred Porciúncula</p> <p>\"Code reviews are a fundamental part of our job as software developers. Every piece of code we write is (hopefully) carefully reviewed by our teammates before becoming part of our systems. It's an important part of the development process, and it requires significant time and effort.</p> <p>While a great review experience will promote interesting discussions, ensure consistency in the codebase, and potentially catch bugs and implementation oversights, a poor review might lead to nasty bugs and unhappy developers. Still, sometimes it's hard to find the motivation to thoroughly review a pull request, and eventually it just doesn't seem to be worth it given the time you'll need to spend and how hard it usually is to properly review those huge PRs that pop up every now and then.</p> <p>In this talk you'll learn strategies and guidelines that will help improve the efficiency of your team's code reviews. We'll talk about work in progress PRs, commit by commit reviews, emoji driven comments and more. You'll listen to great (and scary) tales of code reviews experiences, and lots of tips and tricks when it comes to preparing the perfect pull request for your peers.\"</p> <p>This month we are hosted by Careem in their office in Karl-Liebknecht-Str. 34 near the Alexanderplatz.</p> ","how_to_find_us":"Careem","visibility":"public"},{"created":1537428212000,"duration":10800000,"id":"sbwsrqyzdblc","name":"Android Co-Learning","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1551380400000,"local_date":"2019-02-28","local_time":"20:00","updated":1551394437000,"utc_offset":3600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":5,"venue":{"id":24674303,"name":"xHain hack+makerspace","lat":52.5128173828125,"lon":13.449541091918945,"repinned":true,"address_1":"Grünberger Straße 14","city":"Berlin","country":"de","localized_country_name":"Germany"},"group":{"created":1414981928000,"name":"GDG Berlin Android","id":18029372,"join_mode":"approval","lat":52.52000045776367,"lon":13.380000114440918,"urlname":"berlindroid","who":"Androids","localized_location":"Berlin, Germany","state":"","country":"de","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Berlin"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/berlindroid/events/sbwsrqyzdblc/","description":"<p>Android Co-Learning is a weekly meetup for Android developers.

However, once you dive into it, you might start asking questions - should I use alertDialogTheme or alertDialogStyle? Should I use dialogTitle, windowTitle or textAppearanceLarge? It is no secret that the styling and theming system in Android is complex, but I promise there is some method to the madness! We can avoid writing custom components just to achieve pixel perfection if we know how tame to the beast.</p> <p>In this talk, we will learn about the difference between themes and styles, the hierarchy of different styling techniques and how to use them effectively. We will also discuss migrating to the newest app theme in town - the Material Components Theme and using the new attributes that come with it, like “colorOnSurface”.</p> <p>At the end of this talk, you will know how to style your app like a pro with the correct use of Styles, Themes, TextAppearance and sensible defaults while specifying color, shape and typography through Material Theming.\"</p> <p>~~</p> <p>Nicola Corti: Let me write your networking code</p> <p>\"When writing networking code, you want to make sure the code between the client and server implementation is consistent. After spending hours defining the APIs with your backend engineers, you’ll probably need to spend even more time implementing those details over to your code (and guess what… your backend engineers will be doing the same!). This process is boring, time consuming, and prone to errors.</p> <p>Wouldn’t it be cool if this process were automated? If you could have classes and interfaces that mirror your API definition? And if they were automatically tested and ready to use out of the box?</p> <p>It can be done! At Yelp, we define our APIs using Swagger Specs and we successfully automated the generation of our networking code for both servers and clients (iOS &amp; Android). On Android, we generate Kotlin Data Classes and Retrofit APIs that mirror our spec files and are ready to use for all engineers. In this talk, we will explore how we set up our code generation pipeline and how you can start doing it, too.\"</p> <p>~~</p> <p>Like always there will be enough time to socialize and have a drink or two with your fellow Android developers.</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1537428212000,"duration":10800000,"id":"sbwsrqyzgbgb","name":"Android Co-Learning","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1554400800000,"local_date":"2019-04-04","local_time":"20:00","updated":1554417785000,"utc_offset":7200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":10,"venue":{"id":24674303,"name":"xHain hack+makerspace","lat":52.5128173828125,"lon":13.449541091918945,"repinned":true,"address_1":"Grünberger Straße 14","city":"Berlin","country":"de","localized_country_name":"Germany"},"group":{"created":1414981928000,"name":"GDG Berlin Android","id":18029372,"join_mode":"approval","lat":52.52000045776367,"lon":13.380000114440918,"urlname":"berlindroid","who":"Androids","localized_location":"Berlin, Germany","state":"","country":"de","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Berlin"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/berlindroid/events/sbwsrqyzgbgb/","description":"<p>Android Co-Learning is a weekly meetup for Android developers.

In the early days there was the Android Development Tools (ADT) plugin for the Eclipse IDE. On the command line apps were built using an Ant build script. But with both build environments serious projects would quickly reach the limits of what's possible without resorting to more or less ugly hacks.<br/>When the Android tools team introduced Android Studio it came with almost seamless integration with a powerful build system: Gradle. This makes it possible for beginners to get started quickly. At the same time the Gradle build system offers a lot of flexibility that is often needed for large and complex projects.<br/>To make use of this flexibility it's of course necessary to have a closer look at the build system.

Also, we are required to provide the attendees list, so make sure to RSVP one day before the event ⏱</p> <p>As usual, we have two interesting talks from our Android community:</p> <p>Jossi Wolf: Exploring MotionLayout</p> <p>MotionLayout is a new layout based on ConstraintLayout. With MotionLayout, animations and transitions finally are becoming easy to implement! In this talk, you will learn how to use MotionLayout starting with building a simple animation that will replace an existing CollapsingToolbarLayout. As we move on, you will learn about Keyframes, Keycycles and other awesome features of MotionLayout. To help make your animations as awesome as possible, you will also learn how to make them follow the Material Design Guidelines using interpolations and fine-grained details about motion.</p> <p>----</p> <p>Adrian Schäfer: Dagger Multibindings for Android<br/>This talk will show how to use Dagger Multibindings, but more importantly why you should use it.<br/>We will will look at a typical Android use case and see why we should refactor it and how we can do so with Dagger Multibindings.</p> <p>Like always there will be enough time to socialize with your fellow Android developers.</p>
