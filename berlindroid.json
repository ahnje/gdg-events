Simple code snippets will be used to explain MVVM implementation and testing and showcase the advantages over MVP. Engineering war stories along with our lessons learned will be shared so you can avoid the mistakes we have made. I will also give you our answer for: is Rx a remedy for all ills and difficulties in every codebase or can the medicine have unforeseen adverse effects?\"</i></p> <p>Instead of a second presentation, we'd like to get a discussion going about the hottest new Android-related things announced at Google I/O.

Then we will briefly compare with the other alternative solutions. Lastly, we will see how easy it is to connect Google\u2019s Firebase infrastructure to have cloud connected devices.</i></p> <p>Like always, there will be plenty of time for socializing.

This month we'll have the following two presentations:</p> <p>Miriam Busch, Muhammed Salih Güler, Álvaro Santisteban Diéguez: <b>Improving development skills with Udacity's Android Nanodegrees \u2013 A team's review</b></p> <p><i>Udacity and Google collaborated to create two online courses for Android developers: \"Android Basics\" and \"Android Developer\". We will share our experiences taking these classes from the points of view of a junior developer, an intermediate developer, a senior developer and their manager.<br/></i></p> <p>Stefan Medack: <b>Data Classes and parsing JSON \u2013 A Story about converting Models to Kotlin </b></p> <p><i>Since the announcement of official Kotlin support at Google I/O we can be sure that Kotlin is here to stay and you can already feel the boost this language is getting. At Kitchen Stories we love this uprise and we are migrating our code base gradually to leverage the new features this language provides us.<br/></i><i>In this session, I want to take you along the journey on how and why we migrated all our POJOs to POKOs. You will learn how Kotlins data classes, constructor default values and non-nullability can enable a more robust JSON parsing and how you can improve parsing with Moshi.</i></p> <p>And of course there will be plenty of time to chat and enjoy a cold beverage or two.</p> <p>You may also be interested to know that <a href=\"https://2017.devfest-berlin.de/\">DevFest Berlin</a> is right around the corner.

I did, many times! Fragments are not easy to use, and many experts even recommend to avoid them. But what is the alternative? We tried Conductor, we liked it and I am going to show you what can you do with it.</p> <p>----------------------------------</p> <p>2017 for Androids in Berlin<br/>by Hasan Hosgel</p> <p>Let us recap on the awesomeness that 2017 was.</p> <p>----------------------------------</p> <p>🏴\u200d☠️ ARrrrg! The Google AR Android Demo Application deciphered. 🏴\u200d☠️<br/>by Mario Bodemann</p> <p>This was my first reaction reading through the code of the sample provided by Google for it's new ARCore. After the first shock, I took a close look on how the app works, and what ARCore could do for my use case: Having my virtual collection of toy figures always with me ❤️. 🤖🤴</p> <p>----------------------------------</p> <p>In between the talks we have plenty of awesome time to talk to other Android developers, give feedback on talks and enjoy a drink or two from the bar. Additionally we will have the `flea market` section, where you can present your quick ideas/joboffers/questions to our audience. Think of it as you personal open microphone night, without too much singing.</p> <p>Awesome for you to join and read this far.
