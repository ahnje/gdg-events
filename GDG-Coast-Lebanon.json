For those of you who are not familiar with All Girls Code, it's an initiative, powered by Google Women Techmakers Lebanon, that aims at providing girls aged between 12 and 20 years old hands-on with coding experience, as well as empowering and encouraging them to embark on careers in the STEAM fields. The program fosters coding skills and analytical thinking through different events and mini-projects that demonstrate to the participating girls the benefits of coding in different domains such as Arts, Storytelling, Medicine, Game Design, Finance, and other fields. It also introduces the participants to several local, regional, and international technology initiatives and conferences that are of help to them as they progress in their careers. Girls who participate in All Girls Code events become part of a growing regional network and a mentorship program that provides continuous support to them all year round!<br/>Register here: <a href=\"https://goo.gl/forms/Cbue7Sw5K2lzTfhG2\" class=\"linkified\">https://goo.gl/forms/Cbue7Sw5K2lzTfhG2</a></p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1518001626000,"duration":10800000,"id":"247574326","name":"Introduction to Design Thinking and UX principles","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1518789600000,"local_date":"2018-02-16","local_time":"16:00","updated":1519036227000,"utc_offset":7200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":42,"venue":{"id":25291628,"name":"BDD1280 Building","lat":33.891666412353516,"lon":35.50627136230469,"repinned":false,"address_1":"Bechara El Khoury, Beirut Digital District","city":"Beirut","country":"lb","localized_country_name":"Lebanon"},"group":{"created":1493081153000,"name":"GDG Coast Lebanon","id":23413592,"join_mode":"open","lat":33.880001068115234,"lon":35.5,"urlname":"GDG-Coast-Lebanon","who":"Members","localized_location":"Beirut, Lebanon","state":"","country":"lb","region":"en_US","timezone":"Asia/Beirut"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Coast-Lebanon/events/247574326/","manual_attendance_count":35,"description":"<p>After the big demand we are happy to announce our first talk about design thinking &amp; UX!!</p> <p>If you have a team (existing startup or company) don't forget to check our 2 days full day workshop Sharpen your UX skills with Instructor:</p> <p>Loubna Ibrahim<br/>Product and Innovation Manager at Ideatolife<br/><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/loubnaibrahim/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/loubnaibrahim/</a></p> ","how_to_find_us":"GF","visibility":"public"},{"created":1519127492000,"duration":3600000,"id":"247985652","name":"UX is not only for Designers ","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1519128000000,"local_date":"2018-02-20","local_time":"14:00","updated":1519732203000,"utc_offset":7200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":1,"venue":{"id":25740150,"name":"Hilton Beirut Habtoor Grand Hotel","lat":33.86948013305664,"lon":35.53727340698242,"repinned":false,"address_1":"Charles de Gaulle Str","address_2":"Sin El Fil, Horsh Tabet ","city":"Beirut","country":"lb","localized_country_name":"Lebanon"},"group":{"created":1493081153000,"name":"GDG Coast Lebanon","id":23413592,"join_mode":"open","lat":33.880001068115234,"lon":35.5,"urlname":"GDG-Coast-Lebanon","who":"Members","localized_location":"Beirut, Lebanon","state":"","country":"lb","region":"en_US","timezone":"Asia/Beirut"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Coast-Lebanon/events/247985652/","manual_attendance_count":80,"description":"<p>Know More about UX !</p> <p>If you have a team (existing startup or company) don't forget to check our 2 days full day workshop Sharpen your UX skills with Instructor:</p> <p>Loubna Ibrahim<br/>Product and Innovation Manager at Ideatolife<br/><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/loubnaibrahim/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/loubnaibrahim/</a></p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1520324096000,"duration":10800000,"id":"248461895","name":"IoT with Esp8266!","rsvp_limit":30,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1520438400000,"local_date":"2018-03-07","local_time":"18:00","updated":1520514945000,"utc_offset":7200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":17,"venue":{"id":25703009,"name":"GDG Coast Lebanon","lat":33.88493728637695,"lon":35.49126052856445,"repinned":false,"address_1":"Daibes El Murr, Beirut","city":"Beirut","country":"lb","localized_country_name":"Lebanon"},"group":{"created":1493081153000,"name":"GDG Coast Lebanon","id":23413592,"join_mode":"open","lat":33.880001068115234,"lon":35.5,"urlname":"GDG-Coast-Lebanon","who":"Members","localized_location":"Beirut, Lebanon","state":"","country":"lb","region":"en_US","timezone":"Asia/Beirut"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Coast-Lebanon/events/248461895/","manual_attendance_count":20,"description":"<p>• What we'll do<br/>We will be running a small workshop to explore the ESP8266 board and its use in IoT applications. 2 applications will be done: 1) application of WiFi geolocator using Google Maps Geolocator API 2) application via ThingSpeak for smart and remote monitoring of plants.
