He mainly works with Java, Angular, HTML5, Typescript. During the weekends he occasionally codes on Ionic sometimes cluelessly tinkerers with Arduino . When he feels like he needs a change of scenery, he occasionally tries his hands on baking and cooking. He is has a quirky sense of humor and likes to indulge in creepypastas, and occasionally binge on DIY videos.</p> <p>Henry Lim<br/>Henry is a front-end web developer from Kuala Lumpur. He’s also a community co-organizer of Google Developer Group Kuala Lumpur.<br/>He’s a big fan of Google’s cutting-edge technologies, including Polymer, Progressive Web Apps, and Firebase. He will stop at nothing to educate everyone around him about them.<br/>While he’s not coding, he likes to play piano and listen to his favorite band - Mayday.</p> <p>Jecelyn Yeen<br/>Jecelyn specializes in professional application development with technologies, including Angular, HTML5, Typescript, JavaScript, CSS, C#, NodeJs and ASP.NET. Jecelyn has over 8 years of programming experience which includes working on ERP, shared services and fintech products, from enterprise to startup. She has held various roles from developer to consultant to team manager to her latest being software architect at a Fortune 500 MNC.<br/>When Jecelyn isn’t busy distinguishing herself as (usually) the only female engineer on her team, she’s funnelling her passion in tech into publishing articles on Medium and Scotch.io as well as sharing her knowledge via workshops and conferences and meet-ups.<br/>She is the current Director of Women Who Code Kuala Lumpur, a non-profit organization that connects and supports women to excel in the tech industry since 2014 through meet ups and codelabs.<br/>Ironically her favourite past time away from work involves travelling to remote islands without WiFi for deep sea diving expeditions and reading books with tangible covers. Springing a rubber spider on her lap is a very effective method of striking terror in her heart.</p> <p>Vin Lim<br/>Vin is the Co-Founder and CEO of Green Room, a leading mobile and web application development company, with a portfolio of major international and local brands. Together with his team, he specialises in cross-platform application development, with technologies like TypeScript, Angular and various modern web technologies.<br/>His journey in the tech and startup scene has sparked his enthusiasm in building tech community, leading to the founding of Startup Penang, GDG George Town and Angular Malaysia.
