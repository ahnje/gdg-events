It's also interoperable between multiple languages.</p> <p>But beyond that fact that it's more efficient than REST, we'll look into how to use gRPC's streaming API, where you can establish server-side streaming, client-side streaming, and bidirectional streaming! This allows developers to build sophisticated real-time applications with ease.</p> <p>In addition to learning about gRPC and HTTP/2 concepts with code and demonstrations, we'll also deep dive into integration with existing build systems such as Maven and Gralde, but also frameworks such as Spring Boot and RxJava.<br/>- Configuring projects to generate gRPC stub code<br/>- Using Protobuf3 to define services<br/>- Creating synchronous and asynchronous services, with streaming<br/>. - Load balancing<br/>- Interceptors</p> <p><b>About The Speaker</b><br/>Ray is a Developer Advocate for the Google Cloud Platform.

Is it getting VMs and your stack running on it? Is it switching from Microsoft Word to Google Docs? What if I'm a developer who wants to avoid doing DevOps work and just get my code online and accessible globally as quickly as possible? It's all of the above! This session begins with a (believe it or not) vendor-agnostic, high-level overview of cloud computing, including its three primary service levels. This is followed by an overview of Google Cloud, its GCP &amp; G Suite developer platforms, and which products serve at which cloud service levels. Specifically, attendees will learn how to run code on serverless platforms. Code samples will be in Python &amp; JavaScript, but other languages are supported. Time-permitting, we'll also discuss some of the GCP Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence tools.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>WESLEY CHUN (@wescpy) is the author of Prentice Hall's bestselling \"Core Python\" (corepython.com) series, co-author of \"Python Web Development with Django\" (withdjango.com), and has written for Linux Journal, CNET, and InformIT.

Isn’t Flutter yet another cross platform promising a single codebase that can run anywhere? Pufff, we’ve seen that already, and it never works…<br/>… except that this time IT WORKS! And not only for mobile apps, but also for desktop and web apps! In this talk, let me show how easy it is to get a Flutter app up and running, explore some of the core concepts of the framework and understand why this time Flutter is the truly “write once, run everywhere” framework.</p> <p>About the speaker:<br/>Jorge Coca is a spanish engineer lost in Chicago. He is writing the book \"Dart 2 In Action\" for Manning Publications. He works at BMW, in the mobile core team, developing the Connected experiences for BMW and MINI.

His work is a mixture of drug discovery from natural products (pharmacognosy) and software development. He started using Kotlin around two years ago and it his now his major language (accompanied by a good deal of Python for all the graphics and statistics).</p> <p>Uddyami Agrawal is an Android Developer with Raise Marketplace. She is serial startup product engineer who specializes in rapid prototyping. She has seen multiple apps, complete their lifecycle from inception to live date. She has done mostly mobile production code but is passionate about full stack development. Kotlin being the new tool she is obsessed with.</p> <p>About the Workshop:<br/>This tutorial walks you through a series of exercises to get familiar with Kotlin.</p> <p>Kotlin Koans are a series of exercises to get you familiar with the Kotlin Syntax. Each exercise is created as a failing unit test and your job is to make it pass. You can work with Kotlin Koans in one of three ways.</p> <p>You can play with Koans online (<a href=\"https://play.kotlinlang.org/koans\" class=\"linkified\">https://play.kotlinlang.org/koans</a>).<br/>You can solve the tasks right inside IntelliJ IDEA or Android Studio by installing the EduTools plugin (<a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/education/install-edutools-plugin.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.jetbrains.com/help/education/install-edutools-plugin.html</a>) and choosing Kotlin Koans course (<a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/education/learner-start-guide.html?section=Kotlin%20Koans\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.jetbrains.com/help/education/learner-start-guide.html?section=Kotlin%20Koans</a>).<br/>You can clone the project on GitHub (<a href=\"https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-koans\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-koans</a>). You can open this project in IntelliJ IDEA, or work with it from the command line using your favourite editor. Note that to work with Koans from Android Studio, use the EduTools plugin.</p> <p>Whatever way you choose to solve koans, you can see the solution for each task. In the online version and inside EduTools plugin you'll find the button \"Show answer\". The GitHub repository has two branches, master which contains the exercises for you to do and resolutions which contains the resolved exercises.

MSFT poured millions into making sure we’ve had types for every popular package and the community has helped deliver the rest.</p> <p>But no matter how many times I ask Chicago Tech or however many Stackoverflow questions I read over, I still struggle typing the most intricate things. React? Node? It’s all the same. Over the last couple of years, I’ve learned a lot about how I can improve this and get the right type, every. single. time.</p> <p>Frontend Testing: Mapping Out the Territory<br/>Abstract: \"Frontend testing is impossible! I don’t have time for it! It makes my productivity tank! My manager won’t allow me to do it!<br/>These are all excuses for not writing tests for your frontend code. In the interest of time, I will focus on the real reasons - I don’t know how, I’m afraid to start - and alleviate the fear by just writing tests and showing how easy it is..<br/>I will give a recipe that you can follow to ease your fear of the unknown—writing tests. I will discuss the various kinds of testing and how they fit together in a coherent way, but most importantly - I will give sample code that you can use as a template in your own project.\"</p> <p>About the speakers</p> <p>About Peter Piekarczyk:<br/>Peter Piekarczyk is the co-founder &amp; CTO of Draftbit, a platform that helps teams build React Native and Expo app visually. He’s been an entrepreneur his whole life but still has trouble spelling the word. Peter’s built and maintained projects for React, React Native, React Navigation, Apollo GraphQL and ReasonML.</p> <p>About Gil Tayar:<br/>From the olden days of DOS, to the contemporary world of Software Testing, Gil was, is, and always will be, a software developer. He has in the past co-founded WebCollage, survived the bubble collapse of 2000, and worked on various big cloudy projects at Wix.<br/>His current passion is figuring out how to test software, a passion which he has turned into his main job as Evangelist and Senior Architect at Applitools. He has religiously tested all his software, from the early days as a junior software developer to the current days at Applitools, where he develops tests for software that tests software, which is almost one meta layer too many for him.</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1578975300000,"duration":7200000,"id":"267898110","name":"Data Studio Community Connectors and Visualization Code Lab","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1582243200000,"local_date":"2020-02-20","local_time":"18:00","updated":1582252383000,"utc_offset":-21600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":136,"venue":{"id":26366866,"name":"Google Chicago Fulton Market","lat":41.88730239868164,"lon":-87.65238189697266,"repinned":true,"address_1":"320 N Morgan St #600","city":"Chicago","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"60607","state":"IL"},"group":{"created":1425433375000,"name":"Google Developers Group: GDG Chicago","id":18475894,"join_mode":"open","lat":41.88999938964844,"lon":-87.63999938964844,"urlname":"Google-Developers-Group-GDG-Chicago","who":"Members","localized_location":"Chicago, IL","state":"IL","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Central"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/Google-Developers-Group-GDG-Chicago/events/267898110/","description":"<p>Agenda:<br/>6:00-6:30: Socialize Food and announcements<br/>6:30-7:45: Codelab/Workshop<br/>Bio:<br/>Yulan is a Developer Advocate for Google’s Data Studio.
