We'll start by some networking and pizzas then we'll have the following talks: <br/>-Jasmin Ghoul (Google) will be talking about the new EMEA App Hub.<br/>Google\u2019s international headquarters in Dublin is the growth engine for small businesses across (EMEA) Europe, the Middle East and Africa. With mobile devices transforming the way we live, play and work, the AppHub helps app developers from across the region to grow their businesses. <br/>The diversity of app products and services available can sometimes be daunting for new small and medium developers. The AppHub brings together Google experts from each product category, providing virtual and face to face consultations to help developers to become the next big thing.<br/>Jasmin will present on Google's approach to helping thriving appsters develop, engage and earn with their business.</p> <p>-Aibhen and Jake (13 and 11 years old app developers!) will present their road safety app, called TelApath and get help for some of it. The app is to warn all rural road users both pedestrian and drivers, about each other. They plan to develop the technology further for use in other areas in the future but are starting by getting this app launched first.</p> <p>-Doug Sillars (AT&amp;T)<br/>Bad implementations of good ideas: How systemic inattention to performance can kill your mobile app<br/>It seems like common sense: apps that crash are used less than apps that run as expected. Therefore, development resources are often committed to reducing app crashes to improve engagement. However, these same apps often launch without any attention paid to app performance. Recent research shows that customer reaction to slow application performance is similar to crashes: uninstalls, bad reviews, and one-star ratings.<br/>In this talk, Doug will look at several top mobile applications and how poorly implemented features with no consideration for performance led to outages, customer complaints, and low engagement. Through our analysis of applications and by helping development teams raise awareness of performance impacts, these applications have improved their performance \u2013 delighting customers with faster applications that do not kill their battery, their data plan, or their patience.<br/>Doug Sillars is a leader in the mobile performance community, focusing on helping developers improve the speed and performance of mobile websites and applications. Doug has presented AT&amp;T\u2019s award winning performance tools at developer conferences around the world. A member of the AT&amp;T Developer Program for the last 11 years, Doug is the technical lead on the performance outreach team. He is the author of O'Reilly's \"High Performance Android Apps\". In his spare time, Doug enjoys playing soccer with his wife and three children, shooing the muddy dogs off the sofa, and taking care of the various bunnies, chickens and furry goats that they keep on a small farm outside of Seattle.</p> <p>Please make sure to have your EventBrite ticket.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/gdg-dublin-november-2015-meeting-tickets-19545458994\"><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/gdg-dublin-november-2015-meeting-tickets-19545458994\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/gdg-dublin-november-2015-meeting-tickets-19545458994</a></a></p> <p>#android</p> <p>#admob</p> <p>#mobile</p> ","how_to_find_us":"Entrance to use: Beside the SPAR.","visibility":"public"},{"created":1449232861000,"duration":25200000,"id":"227207240","name":"Xmas special in 3D","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1450521000000,"local_date":"2015-12-19","local_time":"10:30","rsvp_close_offset":"PT48H","updated":1501849643000,"utc_offset":0,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":21,"venue":{"id":24224228,"name":"Google","lat":53.34033966064453,"lon":-6.236417770385742,"repinned":false,"address_1":"Barrow street","city":"Dublin","country":"ie","localized_country_name":"Ireland"},"group":{"created":1448287339000,"name":"GDG Dublin","id":19147770,"join_mode":"open","lat":53.33000183105469,"lon":-6.25,"urlname":"GDG-Dublin","who":"Members","localized_location":"Dublin, Ireland","state":"","country":"ie","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Dublin"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Dublin/events/227207240/","manual_attendance_count":30,"description":"<p><b>Please make sure to have an EventBrite ticket for this event:</b></p> <p><b><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/xmas-special-in-3d-gdg-dublin-3dcamp-dublin-dublin-unity-user-group-tickets-19778402735\"><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/xmas-special-in-3d-gdg-dublin-3dcamp-dublin-dublin-unity-user-group-tickets-19778402735\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/xmas-special-in-3d-gdg-dublin-3dcamp-dublin-dublin-unity-user-group-tickets-19778402735</a></a></b></p> <p><b><br/></b></p> <p>Join us for a Saturday of fun playing with anything 3D.</p> <p>This event is organised with our friends:</p> <p><b>Dublin Unity User Group:</b></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Unity3dDublin/\"><a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Unity3dDublin/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.meetup.com/Unity3dDublin/</a></a></p> <p><b>3Dcamp Dublin</b>: <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/3DcampDublin/\"><a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/3DcampDublin/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.meetup.com/3DcampDublin/</a></a> &amp; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/3dcamp\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/3dcamp\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/3dcamp</a></a></p> <p>We'll have demos (AR, VR, Cardboards, Project Tango,...) and you can also bring and demo your own project at the Show and Tell.

The best way to get to grips with it is through practical, hands-on experience. In this session we'll be looking at a sample Android app which uses themoviedb.org API (which some of you may remember from the DevFest hackathon), and applying RxJava to simplify our network calls, our threading, and even our user interaction code. While this will be aimed at Android, most of the content will be valid and applicable for regular Java too.</p> <p><b>2 - Talks</b></p> <p><b>Taking control: Input devices at Android ecosystem</b> (Gleb Lebedev)<br/>There are various devices that can be used with Android to get an input from users. The most common way is touch. Let's explore the world beyond screen gestures: remote controls, gamepads, MIDI, USB host interface and network. <br/>The talk will cover the following topics:<br/>- A shot observation of various wireless and wired input devices<br/>- MIDI API in Android 6.0 <br/>- USB API and USB-to-serial adapters<br/>- ESP8266 microcontroller and UDP messaging</p> <p><b>Material Design for web pages</b> (Raphael Savina)<br/>Material Design Lite lets you add a Material Design look and feel to your websites. It doesn\u2019t rely on any JavaScript frameworks and aims to optimize cross-device use, gracefully degrade in older browsers, and offer an experience that is immediately accessible.</p> ","how_to_find_us":"Use the entrance beside Spar","visibility":"public"},{"created":1454856545000,"duration":7200000,"id":"228678248","name":"GDG Dublin - Study Jams: Android for Beginners or Web Optimisation","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1456252200000,"local_date":"2016-02-23","local_time":"18:30","rsvp_close_offset":"PT96H","updated":1501849670000,"utc_offset":0,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":56,"venue":{"id":24224228,"name":"Google","lat":53.34033966064453,"lon":-6.236417770385742,"repinned":false,"address_1":"Barrow street","city":"Dublin","country":"ie","localized_country_name":"Ireland"},"group":{"created":1448287339000,"name":"GDG Dublin","id":19147770,"join_mode":"open","lat":53.33000183105469,"lon":-6.25,"urlname":"GDG-Dublin","who":"Members","localized_location":"Dublin, Ireland","state":"","country":"ie","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Dublin"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Dublin/events/228678248/","manual_attendance_count":25,"description":"<p>Join us again this year for a Study Jam.</p> <p><b>Ticket: <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/gdg-dublin-study-jams-android-for-beginners-or-web-optimisation-tickets-21413917604\"><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/gdg-dublin-study-jams-android-for-beginners-or-web-optimisation-tickets-21413917604\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/gdg-dublin-study-jams-android-for-beginners-or-web-optimisation-tickets-21413917604</a></a></b></p> <p>The format would be the same as we had before for Android, but this time we will have two themes:</p> <p><b>-Android for Beginners course:</b></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.udacity.com/account/affiliate/GoogleStudyJams\"><a href=\"https://www.udacity.com/account/affiliate/GoogleStudyJams\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.udacity.com/account/affiliate/GoogleStudyJams</a></a></p> <p>Approx. 4 weeks - Assumes 6hrs/wk (work at your own pace).

The AR.js project is an enabler for these fields. It allows people to easily make AR on the web. It is very fast (it runs 60fps even on 2 year-old phones! )</p> <p>In the talk, you will see the advantages of web-based AR, what others have created with it in the past and how easy it is to create your own AR experience.</p> <p>Right now most of you have a phone capable of doing AR without installation. You don't have to wait for everybody to buy AR enabled devices anymore (such as Tango, Moverio...etc.). You already have one, in your pocket! And we will show you how to use it, open-source and free or charge.</p> <p><b>Facebook Bots With Your Free Google Cloud Instance by </b><b><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/105349722296626420678\">Anthony Isaakidis</a></b></p> <p>Ant will cover look at the bot ecosystem and maybe deep dive a bit on the Messenger API + GCP.</p> <p><b>GCP: To infinity and beyond by David Gonzalez<br/></b></p> <p>David, our newly appointed Cloud GDE will go over all the Next 17 announcement </p> <p><b>Alerter - An Android Alerting Library by Kevin Murphy (Tapadoo)</b></p> <p>A demo of the library, how to use it in your app, and the basics of open sourcing for Android.</p> <p><b>Get your tickets:</b></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/gdg-dublin-march-2017-tickets-32827370549\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/gdg-dublin-march-2017-tickets-32827370549</a></p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1494959769000,"duration":30600000,"id":"240034459","name":"I/O Extended Dublin 2017","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1495024200000,"local_date":"2017-05-17","local_time":"13:30","updated":1497720293000,"utc_offset":3600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":4,"venue":{"id":24224228,"name":"Google","lat":53.34033966064453,"lon":-6.236417770385742,"repinned":false,"address_1":"Barrow street","city":"Dublin","country":"ie","localized_country_name":"Ireland"},"group":{"created":1448287339000,"name":"GDG Dublin","id":19147770,"join_mode":"open","lat":53.33000183105469,"lon":-6.25,"urlname":"GDG-Dublin","who":"Members","localized_location":"Dublin, Ireland","state":"","country":"ie","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Dublin"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Dublin/events/240034459/","manual_attendance_count":509,"description":"<p>All the details: <br/><a href=\"https://events.withgoogle.com/io-dublin/\"><a href=\"https://events.withgoogle.com/io-dublin/\" class=\"linkified\">https://events.withgoogle.com/io-dublin/</a></a></p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1497249049000,"duration":9000000,"id":"240725724","name":"Google I/O 17 Extended Extended...","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1497979800000,"local_date":"2017-06-20","local_time":"18:30","updated":1501850159000,"utc_offset":3600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":97,"venue":{"id":24224228,"name":"Google","lat":53.34033966064453,"lon":-6.236417770385742,"repinned":false,"address_1":"Barrow street","city":"Dublin","country":"ie","localized_country_name":"Ireland"},"group":{"created":1448287339000,"name":"GDG Dublin","id":19147770,"join_mode":"open","lat":53.33000183105469,"lon":-6.25,"urlname":"GDG-Dublin","who":"Members","localized_location":"Dublin, Ireland","state":"","country":"ie","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Dublin"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Dublin/events/240725724/","manual_attendance_count":57,"description":"<p>Let's revisit all the announcements from I/O.</p> <p>-Brendan Fahy: \"Google I/O: Extended Bonus Features\"</p> <p>-Rory Glynn: \"Building an Android Things Tweet Viewer at <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23io17extended\">#io17extended</a>\"</p> <p><b>Tickets:</b></p> <p><b><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/google-io-17-extended-extended-tickets-35339407118\"><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/google-io-17-extended-extended-tickets-35339407118\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/google-io-17-extended-extended-tickets-35339407118</a></a></b></p> <p>More talks TBC...﻿</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1500318449000,"duration":9000000,"id":"241796490","name":"GDG Dublin - July 2017","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1501003800000,"local_date":"2017-07-25","local_time":"18:30","updated":1501850036000,"utc_offset":3600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":104,"venue":{"id":24224228,"name":"Google","lat":53.34033966064453,"lon":-6.236417770385742,"repinned":false,"address_1":"Barrow street","city":"Dublin","country":"ie","localized_country_name":"Ireland"},"group":{"created":1448287339000,"name":"GDG Dublin","id":19147770,"join_mode":"open","lat":53.33000183105469,"lon":-6.25,"urlname":"GDG-Dublin","who":"Members","localized_location":"Dublin, Ireland","state":"","country":"ie","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Dublin"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Dublin/events/241796490/","manual_attendance_count":79,"description":"<p>Get your ticket:<br/><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/gdg-dublin-july-2017-tickets-36281368550\"><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/gdg-dublin-july-2017-tickets-36281368550\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/gdg-dublin-july-2017-tickets-36281368550</a></a></p> <p>Join us for an evening of talks!</p> <p>Confirmed:</p> <p>Movie Night with TensorFlow by Maurice Gavin<br/>AI first is as hot a topic today as mobile first was in the late 2000\u2019s. Startups, businesses, and developers are releasing fantastic applications each week which is driven by machine learning.<br/>In this session, we\u2019ll give an overview of the technology and explore a quirky use case that should not only inspire you to try it out for yourself but also tackle that age old question of \u201cwhat should I watch on t.v. tonight? </p> <p>Playful apps by Raul Portales People use the apps they enjoy using. Once you are done with a solid app and smooth UX, what's next? The next step is Playful design, a games industry term meaning \"delight the user\". In this talk you can learn the best practices from a Google Developer Expert on how to get the maximum feedback for the minimum input. Playful design is meaningful animation and transitions as presented in material design, but it is also much more. With the standard animation framework you can add Playful design all the way back to ICS (minSdk=14). Disclaimer: the devil is in the details; make your users happier at the subconscious level and they will be your best marketing assets. </p> <p>Givebox by Gianfranco Palumbo How Givebox developed Android and iOS mobile apps to give things away and make others happy. </p> <p>#TensorFlow #android #gdg</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1505493211000,"duration":9000000,"id":"243393585","name":"GDG Dublin - Sept 2017 - introducing: Firebase Dublin","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1506447000000,"local_date":"2017-09-26","local_time":"18:30","updated":1507462623000,"utc_offset":3600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":92,"venue":{"id":24224228,"name":"Google","lat":53.34033966064453,"lon":-6.236417770385742,"repinned":false,"address_1":"Barrow street","city":"Dublin","country":"ie","localized_country_name":"Ireland"},"group":{"created":1448287339000,"name":"GDG Dublin","id":19147770,"join_mode":"open","lat":53.33000183105469,"lon":-6.25,"urlname":"GDG-Dublin","who":"Members","localized_location":"Dublin, Ireland","state":"","country":"ie","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Dublin"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Dublin/events/243393585/","manual_attendance_count":82,"description":"<p>Make sure to get an Eventbrite ticket for this event: <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/gdg-dublin-sept-2017-introducing-firebase-dublin-tickets-37949432775\"><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/gdg-dublin-sept-2017-introducing-firebase-dublin-tickets-37949432775\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/gdg-dublin-sept-2017-introducing-firebase-dublin-tickets-37949432775</a></a></p> <p>Join us for our next meetup with a packed agenda.</p> <p>We'll introduce a newly created group: Firebase Dublin.

We will see how they allow developers to verify the trustworthiness of the devices their apps run on, as well as examples of how to implement them to improve your app\u2019s security.</p> <p>Next, we will share first hand experience of hardening an Android app that handles medical &amp; health information. We will see where patient data had the potential to be leaked to 3rd parties and the measures taken to resolve this.</p> <p>In this current climate of heightened user awareness we need to show that we can protect the users of our products, after this session you will be better able to do just that.</p> <p>\u201cPerformance of Mobile Apps\u201d - Doug Sillars (Freelance Developer Advocate/Solutions Architect)</p> <p>Doug Sillars, author of \"High Performance Android Apps\" will present a talk that goes over best practices, and shows examples of how improvements made mobile apps run better.</p> <p>\"TensorFlow and AI\" - Laurence Moroney (Staff Developer Advocate, Google)</p> <p>Your next app might be a model! In this talk, Laurence Moroney from the Google Brain team will talk about TensorFlow and how you can use it to train Machine-Learned models that provide inference on input data.

In fact, many senior citizens today use their phones as an assistive technology through their mobile applications. Considering this use of mobile devices by older people, and most importantly that the global population is rapidly ageing, it is now more relevant than ever to design mobile interfaces that focuses on their needs. Such needs relate to certain changes that people face while ageing, which have an impact on how they interact with a mobile device. However, most of the mobile interfaces are not designed optimally for older people. To address this, some usability and accessibility guidelines for older people have been suggested. But, there is no evaluation on how and to what extent the industry is implementing these guidelines, which will be the focus of this talk.</p> <p>\"Why Blockchain Companies Needs UX Design\" - Luana Calvancati (UX/UI Designer @ TradeIX)</p> <p>In a 2017 study on \u201cTrust in Technology\u201d, covering 12,000 people across 11 countries, the HSBC found that 80% of people had never heard of or don\u2019t know what blockchain or distributed ledgers are. In fact, among specific technologies asked about, blockchain was the one least heard about.<br/>What is commonly observed is that the technical jargon deters many from signing up.<br/>Blockchain advancements is financially affecting a great citizens in both underdeveloped and developed nations, and are already doing so through cryptocurrencies and Smart Contracts.<br/>Smart Contracts, which run decentralized applications, democratize industries like the music and energy sectors and the user research carried around the user needs and behavior plays an important part when you need to translate an emerging technology (blockchain), with its own terminology and specificities to the users \u201clanguage\u201d.</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1533826240000,"duration":9000000,"id":"253645929","name":"GDG Dublin - August 2018 - Diving in to Flutter","rsvp_limit":4,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1535477400000,"local_date":"2018-08-28","local_time":"18:30","updated":1535501203000,"utc_offset":3600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":4,"venue":{"id":24224228,"name":"Google","lat":53.34033966064453,"lon":-6.236417770385742,"repinned":false,"address_1":"Barrow street","city":"Dublin","country":"ie","localized_country_name":"Ireland"},"group":{"created":1448287339000,"name":"GDG Dublin","id":19147770,"join_mode":"open","lat":53.33000183105469,"lon":-6.25,"urlname":"GDG-Dublin","who":"Members","localized_location":"Dublin, Ireland","state":"","country":"ie","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Dublin"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Dublin/events/253645929/","description":"<p>Get your ticket here: <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2OTVPEB\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/2OTVPEB</a></p> <p>Diving In To Flutter:<br/>Get your laptops ready because Matt Sullivan (Flutter Developer Relations Lead, Google) is visiting from Mountain View for a talk and Codelab!</p> <p>Flutter is Google\u2019s new SDK for building mobile apps on Android and iOS.
