If you are a newcomer, you might be tempted to jump straight into using a graphic design tool, like Sketch or Photoshop. However, there is a high possibility that this path will lead you to do work that is unnecessary. Or, even worse, lead you to design a product that users don’t want. So, what are your options then? Here’s an idea…How about taking a more holistic approach and starting with the story? In her book, The User’s Journey: Storymapping Products that People Love, Donna Lichaw highlights how important the use of story is when designing a new or existing product. She goes on to outline three important techniques: the concept story, the origin story, and the usage story. This talk is an overview of how she describes story when it's applied to product design. It will also walk you through how to use those three techniques with a custom-made example.</p> <p>Joshwin Greene is a long-time member of GDG Fresno and WTM Fresno. He graduated with a degree in Software Engineering from UC Irvine in 2016. He is also a Fresno City College alumni. He is both a product designer and a software developer.
