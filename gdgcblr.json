His session would focus around generic GCP architecture and as to what makes GCP different (and hopefully interesting) compared to other cloud providers. The session would also expand upon CloudRun which is a great new service with broad applications. Talk would conclude with a session on AutoML which will be a fun talk that shows how developers can build custom machine learning models without having to become Machine Learning and TensorFlow experts</p> <p>Our second speaker of the day is Sathish VJ who has all the GCP technical certifications under his belt. The focus of his talk would be to provide the required tips and tricks to prepare for the Professional Cloud Architect (PCA) certification exam.</p> <p>Here's the tentative agenda:<br/>9:30 AM - 10:00 AM : Welcome and Registration<br/>10:00 AM - 11:30 AM : Session by Kevin Nelson<br/>11:30 AM - 11:45 AM : Q &amp; A<br/>11:45 AM - 12:30 PM : Session by Sathish VJ<br/>12:30 PM - 01:00 PM : Snacks/Refreshments/Networking</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false}],"upcoming":[{"created":1572708588000,"duration":28800000,"id":"266161392","name":"Google Cloud Community Day 2019","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"upcoming","time":1575343800000,"local_date":"2019-12-03","local_time":"09:00","updated":1574078695000,"utc_offset":19800000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":3,"venue":{"id":26632038,"name":"Taj MG Road, Bengaluru","lat":12.973259925842285,"lon":77.61966705322266,"repinned":false,"address_1":"41/3, MG Road","city":"Bengaluru","country":"in","localized_country_name":"India"},"group":{"created":1528037176000,"name":"GDG Cloud Bengaluru","id":28689777,"join_mode":"open","lat":12.970000267028809,"lon":77.55999755859375,"urlname":"gdgcblr","who":"Members","localized_location":"Bangalore, India","state":"","country":"in","region":"en_US","timezone":"Asia/Calcutta"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdgcblr/events/266161392/","description":"<p>** For working professionals ONLY.
