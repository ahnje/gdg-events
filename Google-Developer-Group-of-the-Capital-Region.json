By understanding the \u2018why\u2019 and \u2018where\u2019 we\u2019ll be able to understand the \u2018when\u2019 of using a reactive style of programming.</p> <p>After understanding the reasons for using a reactive pattern we\u2019ll discuss what kind of tools/frameworks are available and then settle on RxJS. RxJS isn\u2019t the only option, but it is the framework of choice for both Netflix and the Angular team. We\u2019ll look at some examples and basic usages to illustrate getting started with RxJS and talk about some resources available for learning more. </p> <p>=======================</p> <p>4. Building a Microservices Platform with Kubernetes - Matthew Mark Miller, Apprenda Architect</p> <p>This is a preview of a talk Matthew will deliver in SF at QCon in November.</p> <p>See:</p> <p><a href=\"https://qconsf.com/sf2016/users/mark-matthew-miller\" class=\"linkified\">https://qconsf.com/sf2016/users/mark-matthew-miller</a></p> <p>We have the distinct pleasure of providing feedback to and interacting with to Matthew, as he represents Apprenda at some of the highest levels in the Open Source, Cloud-Native Computing space.</p> <p>Abstract:</p> <p>A microservices architecture makes software easier to build and deploy with high availability using decoupled teams. The trade-off for this is increased complexity for deployment, operations and a high potential for duplication of labor.<br/>One way to control these trade-offs is to build domain specific services on top of a common platform.</p> <p>Kubernetes is a container orchestration system open sourced by Google and incubated by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). Far from simply moving and monitoring jailed processes, Kubernetes adds higher level abstractions that make the introduction of platform type behaviors easier while maintaining the microservices goals of high availability and team independence.</p> <p>We will review Kubernetes\u2019 primitives and walk through the implementation of some common microservices patterns on top of them, including rolling deployments, stateful services and adding behaviors via sidecars.</p> <p>=======================================================</p> <p>See you on 10/18 folks.</p> <p>Jason and Kris</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1474123746000,"duration":30600000,"id":"234197149","name":"DevFestCR2016 - Registration is OPEN!","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1478955600000,"local_date":"2016-11-12","local_time":"08:00","updated":1479056387000,"utc_offset":-18000000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":30,"venue":{"id":24793405,"name":"HVCC TEC-SMART","lat":42.96834945678711,"lon":-73.76937866210938,"repinned":false,"address_1":"345 Hermes Rd","city":"Malta","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"","state":"NY"},"group":{"created":1462974281000,"name":"Google Developer Group of the Capital Region","id":19940484,"join_mode":"open","lat":43.0099983215332,"lon":-73.86000061035156,"urlname":"Google-Developer-Group-of-the-Capital-Region","who":"Members","localized_location":"Ballston Spa, NY","state":"NY","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Eastern"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/Google-Developer-Group-of-the-Capital-Region/events/234197149/","description":"<p>Hello GDG Capital Region members!</p> <p>We are proud to announce we will be holding a Google DevFest event.

Jupyter supports multiple different languages (R, Python, Spark, Scala, Haskell, Ruby, etc.), integrates presentations, written content including sophisticated encodings such as LaTeX, supports a cloud deployment, and can be paired with an autograder.  Externally, Jupyter notebooks are being used in<a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/datalab/\"> Google's DataLab Project</a>,<a href=\"http://datascience.ibm.com/\"> IBM's Data Science Experience</a>, and<a href=\"https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/machinelearning/2015/07/24/introducing-jupyter-notebooks-in-azure-ml-studio/\"> Microsoft's Azure ML Studio</a><i>. </i></p> <p>I\u2019ll demonstrate a few examples of using Google API\u2019s (Translate, Vision) from Jupyter notebooks.</p> <p><b>Jason Kuruzovich is Director of the Severino Center for Technological Entrepreneurship and Associate Professor of Business Analytics at RPI</b></p> <p>Jason is an academic entrepreneur who works on problems in which analytics can have a meaningful impact. Through his role as Director of the Severino Center for Technological Entrepreneurship, Jason manages a wide variety of programs to encourage entrepreneurship through contexts, communities, and mentorship opportunities. Jason has been directly involved in the launch of numerous entrepreneurship programs including Foundry-RPI, Startup Tech Valley meetup, NSF Funded NYS Capital Region I-Corp Site Program (PI for grant). He has been recognized as one of the Albany Business Review\u2019s 40 under 40 in the Capital Region and received the Center for Economic Growth (CEG) Technology Innovation Award. He also received the 2016 Upstate Venture <i>Connect Campus</i> Connector Award. Jason also teaches the <i>Technology Foundations</i> and the <i>Capstone</i> course for the RPI MS Business Analytics program, which was ranked 3rd in the world by <a href=\"https://tfetimes.com/best-business-analytics-program-rankings/\"> TFE Times</a>.  His latest project the <a href=\"http://analyticsdojo.com/\"> AnalyticsDojo.com</a> is aimed at providing high quality analytics Education to students and enterprises.</p> <p>We are pleased and honored to have Jason Kuruzovich share his experiences to kick off this event.</p> <p>==========</p> <p>Make sure to bring your laptops to this event, as we will have a generous supply of free tokens to allow us to get hands-on with the GCP codelabs (<a href=\"https://codelabs.developers.google.com/next17\">check them out here</a>).

Put on your rose-colored VR headset and you\u2019ll see the promise of unparalleled ease. Scroll, bleary-eyed through your social media feed and you\u2019ll spot all manner of dystopian futures. Yet, the goal of designers, developers, and anyone creating tech futures is to make the world tangibly better. How do we design a human future with machines? In this session, we'll try out 3 ways to shift our perspective and move beyond boom and doom.</p> <p>Janet's Keynote:</p> <p>Software Across our Society and Culture</p> <p>We're all aware of how many aspects of our functioning in the economy and society are intermediated - in fact shaped - by software. We're also aware that our dependence on apps and devices is increasing, and the aspects of our lives that do not yet involve software are vanishing rapidly. These facts should call into question what role technology companies and software developers play in our culture as a whole. For those of us who are economically secure, stable, and well educated, technology presents opportunities for greater productivity. What does the seemingly irreversible ascendancy of software mean for those of us who are not economically secure, stable, and well educated? Who is being left out, and what do all of us lose when the makers of technology do not represent the full diversity of our society? How can we view a drive to increase diversity in the developer community, and code literacy across the board, as an imperative rather than an option?</p> <p>Come for these great talks and our lightning talk session also.</p> <p>If you are interested in sharing a tech talk in the future, please reach out to: [masked]</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1530237653000,"duration":19800000,"id":"252253223","name":"I/O Extended 2018","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1532181600000,"local_date":"2018-07-21","local_time":"10:00","updated":1532212750000,"utc_offset":-14400000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":18,"venue":{"id":24566007,"name":"CommerceHub, Zen Building, 6th Floor","lat":42.69280242919922,"lon":-73.83119201660156,"repinned":false,"address_1":" 201 Fuller Road","city":"Albany","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"","state":"NY"},"group":{"created":1462974281000,"name":"Google Developer Group of the Capital Region","id":19940484,"join_mode":"open","lat":43.0099983215332,"lon":-73.86000061035156,"urlname":"Google-Developer-Group-of-the-Capital-Region","who":"Members","localized_location":"Ballston Spa, NY","state":"NY","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Eastern"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/Google-Developer-Group-of-the-Capital-Region/events/252253223/","description":"<p>Want to come learn about all of the cool technologies that were announced at the Google I/O Conference this year?</p> <p>The Google Developer Group of the Capital Region is proud to announce we will be holding an event, called I/O Extended, to recap technology announced at the 2018 Google I/O.
