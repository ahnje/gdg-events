Please join us for a Northern venue meetup.

Opening remarks from Informz</p> <p>=======================</p> <p>3. Getting Started with Reactive Programming and RxJS - Zack Fantauzzi, Railroad19</p> <p>Reactive programming isn’t new, but it is getting a lot of attention due to its heavy use by Netflix and its inclusion in Angular 2.0. </p> <p>We’ll start the discussion by understanding what kind of problems the reactive programming paradigm solves. By understanding the ‘why’ and ‘where’ we’ll be able to understand the ‘when’ of using a reactive style of programming.</p> <p>After understanding the reasons for using a reactive pattern we’ll discuss what kind of tools/frameworks are available and then settle on RxJS. RxJS isn’t the only option, but it is the framework of choice for both Netflix and the Angular team. We’ll look at some examples and basic usages to illustrate getting started with RxJS and talk about some resources available for learning more. </p> <p>=======================</p> <p>4. Building a Microservices Platform with Kubernetes - Matthew Mark Miller, Apprenda Architect</p> <p>This is a preview of a talk Matthew will deliver in SF at QCon in November.</p> <p>See:</p> <p><a href=\"https://qconsf.com/sf2016/users/mark-matthew-miller\" class=\"linkified\">https://qconsf.com/sf2016/users/mark-matthew-miller</a></p> <p>We have the distinct pleasure of providing feedback to and interacting with to Matthew, as he represents Apprenda at some of the highest levels in the Open Source, Cloud-Native Computing space.</p> <p>Abstract:</p> <p>A microservices architecture makes software easier to build and deploy with high availability using decoupled teams. The trade-off for this is increased complexity for deployment, operations and a high potential for duplication of labor.<br/>One way to control these trade-offs is to build domain specific services on top of a common platform.</p> <p>Kubernetes is a container orchestration system open sourced by Google and incubated by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). Far from simply moving and monitoring jailed processes, Kubernetes adds higher level abstractions that make the introduction of platform type behaviors easier while maintaining the microservices goals of high availability and team independence.</p> <p>We will review Kubernetes’ primitives and walk through the implementation of some common microservices patterns on top of them, including rolling deployments, stateful services and adding behaviors via sidecars.</p> <p>=======================================================</p> <p>See you on 10/18 folks.</p> <p>Jason and Kris</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1474123746000,"duration":30600000,"id":"234197149","name":"DevFestCR2016 - Registration is OPEN!","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1478955600000,"local_date":"2016-11-12","local_time":"08:00","updated":1479056387000,"utc_offset":-18000000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":30,"venue":{"id":24793405,"name":"HVCC TEC-SMART","lat":42.96834945678711,"lon":-73.76937866210938,"repinned":false,"address_1":"345 Hermes Rd","city":"Malta","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"","state":"NY"},"is_online_event":false,"group":{"created":1462974281000,"name":"GDG Capital Region","id":19940484,"join_mode":"open","lat":43.0099983215332,"lon":-73.86000061035156,"urlname":"Google-Developer-Group-of-the-Capital-Region","who":"Members","localized_location":"Ballston Spa, NY","state":"NY","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Eastern"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/Google-Developer-Group-of-the-Capital-Region/events/234197149/","description":"<p>Hello GDG Capital Region members!</p> <p>We are proud to announce we will be holding a Google DevFest event.

Jupyter supports multiple different languages (R, Python, Spark, Scala, Haskell, Ruby, etc.), integrates presentations, written content including sophisticated encodings such as LaTeX, supports a cloud deployment, and can be paired with an autograder.  Externally, Jupyter notebooks are being used in<a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/datalab/\"> Google's DataLab Project</a>,<a href=\"http://datascience.ibm.com/\"> IBM's Data Science Experience</a>, and<a href=\"https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/machinelearning/2015/07/24/introducing-jupyter-notebooks-in-azure-ml-studio/\"> Microsoft's Azure ML Studio</a><i>. </i></p> <p>I’ll demonstrate a few examples of using Google API’s (Translate, Vision) from Jupyter notebooks.</p> <p><b>Jason Kuruzovich is Director of the Severino Center for Technological Entrepreneurship and Associate Professor of Business Analytics at RPI</b></p> <p>Jason is an academic entrepreneur who works on problems in which analytics can have a meaningful impact. Through his role as Director of the Severino Center for Technological Entrepreneurship, Jason manages a wide variety of programs to encourage entrepreneurship through contexts, communities, and mentorship opportunities. Jason has been directly involved in the launch of numerous entrepreneurship programs including Foundry-RPI, Startup Tech Valley meetup, NSF Funded NYS Capital Region I-Corp Site Program (PI for grant). He has been recognized as one of the Albany Business Review’s 40 under 40 in the Capital Region and received the Center for Economic Growth (CEG) Technology Innovation Award. He also received the 2016 Upstate Venture <i>Connect Campus</i> Connector Award. Jason also teaches the <i>Technology Foundations</i> and the <i>Capstone</i> course for the RPI MS Business Analytics program, which was ranked 3rd in the world by <a href=\"https://tfetimes.com/best-business-analytics-program-rankings/\"> TFE Times</a>.  His latest project the <a href=\"http://analyticsdojo.com/\"> AnalyticsDojo.com</a> is aimed at providing high quality analytics Education to students and enterprises.</p> <p>We are pleased and honored to have Jason Kuruzovich share his experiences to kick off this event.</p> <p>==========</p> <p>Make sure to bring your laptops to this event, as we will have a generous supply of free tokens to allow us to get hands-on with the GCP codelabs (<a href=\"https://codelabs.developers.google.com/next17\">check them out here</a>).

Put on your rose-colored VR headset and you’ll see the promise of unparalleled ease. Scroll, bleary-eyed through your social media feed and you’ll spot all manner of dystopian futures. Yet, the goal of designers, developers, and anyone creating tech futures is to make the world tangibly better. How do we design a human future with machines? In this session, we'll try out 3 ways to shift our perspective and move beyond boom and doom.</p> <p>Janet's Keynote:</p> <p>Software Across our Society and Culture</p> <p>We're all aware of how many aspects of our functioning in the economy and society are intermediated - in fact shaped - by software. We're also aware that our dependence on apps and devices is increasing, and the aspects of our lives that do not yet involve software are vanishing rapidly. These facts should call into question what role technology companies and software developers play in our culture as a whole. For those of us who are economically secure, stable, and well educated, technology presents opportunities for greater productivity. What does the seemingly irreversible ascendancy of software mean for those of us who are not economically secure, stable, and well educated? Who is being left out, and what do all of us lose when the makers of technology do not represent the full diversity of our society? How can we view a drive to increase diversity in the developer community, and code literacy across the board, as an imperative rather than an option?</p> <p>Come for these great talks and our lightning talk session also.</p> <p>If you are interested in sharing a tech talk in the future, please reach out to: [masked]</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1530237653000,"duration":19800000,"id":"252253223","name":"I/O Extended 2018","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1532181600000,"local_date":"2018-07-21","local_time":"10:00","updated":1532212750000,"utc_offset":-14400000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":18,"venue":{"id":24566007,"name":"CommerceHub, Zen Building, 6th Floor","lat":42.69280242919922,"lon":-73.83119201660156,"repinned":false,"address_1":" 201 Fuller Road","city":"Albany","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"","state":"NY"},"is_online_event":false,"group":{"created":1462974281000,"name":"GDG Capital Region","id":19940484,"join_mode":"open","lat":43.0099983215332,"lon":-73.86000061035156,"urlname":"Google-Developer-Group-of-the-Capital-Region","who":"Members","localized_location":"Ballston Spa, NY","state":"NY","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Eastern"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/Google-Developer-Group-of-the-Capital-Region/events/252253223/","description":"<p>Want to come learn about all of the cool technologies that were announced at the Google I/O Conference this year?</p> <p>The Google Developer Group of the Capital Region is proud to announce we will be holding an event, called I/O Extended, to recap technology announced at the 2018 Google I/O.

In different regions, the focus of celebrations ranges from general respect and appreciation toward women to a celebration of women’s economic, political, and social achievements. This day also marks a call to action for accelerating gender parity. International Women’s Day has occurred for over a century, with the first IWD run by the Suffragettes in 1911.</p> <p>This is a global event proposed by Google as part of the Women Techmakers program. It is a series of conferences and workshops that take place around the world during the month of March and April to celebrate International Women’s Day. Through these events Google wishes to highlight the contribution of the work and sacrifices of women leaders in the evolution of the technological field. The goal is to inspire and celebrate women to revolutionize the world with technology.</p> <p>From Ada Lovelace to Grace Hopper (and thousands of Googlers), we’re proud of the contributions women in technology make across our industry and across our community. Having a diversity of perspectives and ideas leads to better decision-making, more relevant products, and makes the industry much more interesting. We believe that by creating the right environments, programs and opportunities, women in tech are better positioned to drive transformational change in the industry and beyond.<br/>Learn more about IWD: <a href=\"https://www.internationalwomensday.com\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.internationalwomensday.com</a></p> <p>We are bringing this celebration to the Capital Region to give local females a unique experience where they can learn from great female examples, discover potential development opportunities, and network with the best role models in the region and, by extension, also across the world (through the WTM / GDG Global networks – see us about this!).</p> <p>We are glad to announce that Capital Region will be celebrating the IWD’19, on April 23rd. The themes of the event are Empowering Women Using Inspiring Stories, and Celebrating Women in Technology. The event will focus on the following topics: #BalanceforBetter and ‘We are Better Together’ (#BetterTogether).

We will discuss which architecture patterns can help give your Flutter<br/>apps a testable, reusable, and cohesive structure.</p> <p>After the talk, you hopefully will have a better picture of what Flutter is capable of, its state of maturity and which use-cases for which it is already being used.</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1571686659000,"duration":19800000,"id":"265854453","name":"Absolutely FREE Cloud Study Jam - Machine Learning - Hands-on Labs - Join us!","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1574521200000,"local_date":"2019-11-23","local_time":"10:00","updated":1574543209000,"utc_offset":-18000000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":26,"venue":{"id":26670600,"name":"Tech Valley Center of Gravity","lat":42.73113250732422,"lon":-73.69010162353516,"repinned":true,"address_1":"30 3rd St","city":"Troy","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"12180","state":"NY"},"is_online_event":false,"group":{"created":1462974281000,"name":"GDG Capital Region","id":19940484,"join_mode":"open","lat":43.0099983215332,"lon":-73.86000061035156,"urlname":"Google-Developer-Group-of-the-Capital-Region","who":"Members","localized_location":"Ballston Spa, NY","state":"NY","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Eastern"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/Google-Developer-Group-of-the-Capital-Region/events/265854453/","description":"<p>Hello Capital Region GDG enthusiasts,</p> <p>Join our community of like-minded developers and explore the latest Google Cloud technologies as a team.</p> <p>Get Cloud Study Jam training from Google and get hands-on experience with Machine Learning, a $55+ value, free of charge.

In different regions, the focus of celebrations ranges from general respect and appreciation toward women to a celebration of women’s economic, political, and social achievements. This day also marks a call to action for accelerating gender parity. International Women’s Day has occurred for over a century, with the first IWD run by the Suffragettes in 1911.</p> <p>This is a global event proposed by Google as part of the Women Techmakers program. It is a series of conferences and workshops that take place around the world during the month of March and April to celebrate International Women’s Day. Through these events Google wishes to highlight the contribution of the work and sacrifices of women leaders in the evolution of the technological field. The goal is to inspire and celebrate women to revolutionize the world with technology.<br/><a href=\"https://www.womentechmakers.com/iwd19\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.womentechmakers.com/iwd19</a></p> <p>From Ada Lovelace to Grace Hopper (and thousands of Googlers), we’re proud of the contributions women in technology make across our industry and across our community. Having a diversity of perspectives and ideas leads to better decision-making, more relevant products, and makes the industry much more interesting. We believe that by creating the right environments, programs and opportunities, women in tech are better positioned to drive transformational change in the industry and beyond.<br/>Learn more about IWD: <a href=\"https://www.internationalwomensday.com\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.internationalwomensday.com</a></p> <p>We are bringing this celebration to the Capital Region to give local females a unique experience where they can learn from great female examples, discover potential development opportunities, and network with the best role models in the region and, across the world through the WTM / GDG Global networks.<br/>IWD'19 - Flashback: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2xN26y9\" class=\"linkified\">https://bit.ly/2xN26y9</a></p> <p>We are glad to announce that Capital Region will be celebrating the IWD’20, on May 23rd. The themes of the event are Empowering Women Using Inspiring Stories, and Celebrating Women in Technology. The event will focus on the following topic: #TogetherWeRise.</p> <p>We are indeed entering an exciting period of history where the world expects more balance. We notice its absence and celebrate its presence. Balance drives a better working world.</p> <p>Join us to interact, meet new and old friends (men and women), highlight our needs and achievements, learn about new opportunities and get inspired, create synergies and build all together the future we want, a future of equal opportunities for all.</p> <p>We embrace diversity of any kind within our audience.<br/>Free registrations are available via our GDG Meetup.<br/>Please be aware that the spots are limited, so please do your RSVP</p> <p>See you there!</p> <p>Agenda:<br/>2:00 - 2:10 Opening Remarks<br/>2:10 - 5:40 Lightning talks: Women In Tech Inspiring Stories<br/>*** Meet our Speakers: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2xN26y9\" class=\"linkified\">https://bit.ly/2xN26y9</a> ***<br/>5:40 - 6:00 Raffle prizes and Closing comments</p> <p>Hosts:<br/>Jason Rotella - Google Developer Group of Capital Region Founder Lead<br/>Chadd Portwine - Google Developer Group of Capital Region Lead<br/>Fausto Hernandez - Google Developer Group of Capital Region Lead<br/>Linda Kovacs - Women Techmakers Ambassador and<br/>Google Developer Group of Capital Region Lead</p> <p>When:<br/>Saturday, May 23, 2020<br/>2:00 PM to 5:30 PM</p> <p>Where:<br/>This is an online event.
