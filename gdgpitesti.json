Poți tu, printr-o linie de cod (generic vorbind) să schimbi viața oamenilor care astăzi se confruntă cu grele încercări? Cum ar fi să dăruiești – prin timpul, abilitățile și expertiza ta – șanse reale celor care nu le au? Sunt lucruri despre care poți să vorbești mai puțin, dar pentru care poți să faci mai mult. Poți mai ales acum, când un maraton de codare se dedică exclusiv dorinței de a limita sau chiar înlătura efectele pandemiei COVID-19 asupra vieții oamenilor.</p> <p>În perioada 8 - 9 - 10 mai, cu pasiune, perseverență și curaj, se deschid noi perspective de proiecte IT care pot avea un impact real și pozitiv în viața oamenilor. Împreună, 20 de echipe formate din 100 de hackeri și 20 de mentori, în doar 48 de ore de codare, vor demonstra că o linie de cod poate face – cu adevărat – lumea un loc mai bun.
