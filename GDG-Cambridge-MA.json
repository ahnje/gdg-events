Best of all, pay only for what you use, running for pennies and scaling to zero. At this session, we'll cover how to build event-driven, low latency web applications using just a few Python or Javascript blocks, with Google Cloud Functions and Firebase.</p> <p>Joe Lust is a software factotum and engineer reinventing software testing at Mabl, using technologies from custom browser extensions to Kubernetes model training grids. Previously a lead developer of the MC10 medical IoT cloud, he has co-founded MDDetails and RunPartner, and organizes the GDG Boston Google Cloud meetup.</p> <p>Google Cloud for AWS Developers - Jeff Whelpley</p> <p>Description: For most of the past 6 years, GetHuman has used Amazon Web Services (AWS) for all hosting and other infrastructure needs. During the past year, however, GetHuman has started to shift more and more development onto Google Cloud Platform (GCP) instead. In this talk, Jeff will explain GCP from the point of view of someone who is intimately familiar with AWS. He will go over the motivations for why you may want to use GCP, give some tips on how to get the most out of GCP and provide a step-by-step approach to migrating from AWS to GCP.</p> <p>Jeff Whelpley is the CTO at GetHuman. He is also a Google Developer Expert, co-organizer Boston Angular meetup, co-organizer Boston AI meetup</p> <p>A big thanks to our food &amp; venue sponsors Google Cloud &amp; Brightcove, and speakers for their time and efforts.</p> <p>Looking forward to seeing you all there!</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1536109628000,"duration":10800000,"id":"254396189","name":"[Day 1 Instructional Workshop] Building Actions for Google Assistant","rsvp_limit":150,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1541196000000,"local_date":"2018-11-02","local_time":"18:00","updated":1541209863000,"utc_offset":-14400000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":139,"venue":{"id":25561319,"name":"General Assembly Boston","lat":42.3530387878418,"lon":-71.05744171142578,"repinned":true,"address_1":"125 Summer Street","city":"Boston","country":"US","localized_country_name":"USA"},"group":{"created":1529350065000,"name":"Google Developer Group (GDG) Cambridge","id":28872269,"join_mode":"open","lat":42.380001068115234,"lon":-71.12999725341797,"urlname":"GDG-Cambridge-MA","who":"Members","localized_location":"Cambridge, MA","state":"MA","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Eastern"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Cambridge-MA/events/254396189/","description":"<p>Join us for a 1.5-day dive into building Actions for Google Assistant - leading by Google Developer Expert, Allen Firstenberg.</p> <p>On Friday evening, we will start with a hands-on instructional workshop covering how to:<br/>- Get started with building your own custom Actions<br/>- Supercharge your Actions with cloud-based machine learning tools<br/>- Deploy your Actions and make them available to billions of devices</p> <p>On Saturday, we will have a full-day hackathon where you can work on building your custom Actions with some help from us if you need it.
