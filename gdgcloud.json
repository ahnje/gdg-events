In this deep dive, how to quickly get set up with TensorFlow on Ubuntu using containers will be shown. To be even more efficient, what is becoming known as transfer learning will be demonstrated. An existing image recognition model will be used rather than the time consuming approach of building one from scratch. Subsequently, this classifier model will be trained with an image dataset. And finally, the retrained model will be live tested with new external images.</p> <p><b><i>\"Containing Data with Kubernetes\"</i></b><br/>Presented by Christian Simon from <a href=\"http://www.jetstack.io/\">JetStack.io</a></p> <p>In Kubernetes 1.3, an alpha ‘PetSet’ feature was added in order to better support the deployment of distributed databases natively in a Kubernetes cluster. We are going take a look how to use PetSets, Dynamic Volume Provisioning and Init Containers for spinning up an ElasticSearch cluster and show that with the latest release running stafeful applications in Kubernetes became a lot easier.</p> <p><b><i><br/></i></b></p> <p><b><i>\"Hadoop and Spark with Dataproc\"</i></b><br/>Presented by Grace Mollison from <a href=\"https://google.com\">Google</a></p> <p>In this talk Grace Mollison a Software Engineer at Google is going to be talking about Google Dataproc, a managed Hadoop &amp; Spark on the Google Cloud Platform (<a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/\"><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/\" class=\"linkified\">https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/</a></a>).</p> <p><b><i><br/></i></b></p> <p><b><i>\"Apache Beam and Dataflow\"</i></b><br/>Presented by Mete Atamel from <a href=\"https://google.com\">Google</a></p> <p>In this session, Mete, a Developer Advocate at Google, will take a look at the history of massive-scale data processing and how it has evolved over the years. We will learn about Apache Beam (incubating) an open source programming model unifying batch and stream processing and see how Apache Beam pipelines can be executed in Google Cloud Dataflow, a fully-managed cloud service for batch and stream data processing.</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1476809749000,"duration":32400000,"id":"234944260","name":"GCP NEXT London Conference","rsvp_limit":25,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1476946800000,"local_date":"2016-10-20","local_time":"08:00","updated":1476981426000,"utc_offset":3600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":25,"venue":{"id":24318069,"name":"InterContinental London - The O2","lat":51.50243377685547,"lon":-0.0002500000118743628,"repinned":false,"address_1":"1 Waterview Dr","city":"London SE10 0TW","country":"gb","localized_country_name":"United Kingdom"},"group":{"created":1452675148000,"name":"GDG Cloud London","id":19331544,"join_mode":"open","lat":51.5099983215332,"lon":-0.07000000029802322,"urlname":"gdgcloud","who":"Developers","localized_location":"London, United Kingdom","state":"17","country":"gb","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/London"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdgcloud/events/234944260/","description":"<p>GCP (Google Cloud Platform) Next Conference in London is full at the moment :</p> <p><a href=\"https://cloudplatformonline.com/NEXT2016-London.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://cloudplatformonline.com/NEXT2016-London.html</a></p> <p>But we are offering our members a last minute chance to participate nonetheless.</p> <p>All those who RSVP for the event right here on meetup will receive a link via email that will allow registration.</p> <p>Places limited.  Hurry up.</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1470973819000,"duration":7200000,"id":"233301496","name":"Python : One App in One Hour","rsvp_limit":120,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1479751200000,"local_date":"2016-11-21","local_time":"18:00","updated":1479819656000,"utc_offset":0,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":105,"venue":{"id":24430752,"name":"Google Office","lat":51.516056060791016,"lon":-0.12714800238609314,"repinned":false,"address_1":"1–13 St. Giles High Street, London, WC2H 8AG","city":"London","country":"gb","localized_country_name":"United Kingdom"},"group":{"created":1452675148000,"name":"GDG Cloud London","id":19331544,"join_mode":"open","lat":51.5099983215332,"lon":-0.07000000029802322,"urlname":"gdgcloud","who":"Developers","localized_location":"London, United Kingdom","state":"17","country":"gb","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/London"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdgcloud/events/233301496/","description":"<p><b>FINAL DATE AND LOCATION</b><b> CONFIRMED</b>!</p> <p>We will be holding a <b>workshop</b> on how to build an app in <b>Python</b> and set it up on the cloud in one hour at the <b>Google Offices at Tottenham Court Road</b>!</p> <p><b>What you must do :</b></p> <p>• Watch the video tutorial below made by our very own<a href=\"http://twitter.com/chrisparsonsdev\"> Chris Parsons</a> (who is a member of the GDG Cloud organising team). </p> <p>• Bring your laptop (and charger) to do some further work at the workshop</p> <p>• Bring some ID just in case building security asks for it at reception to let you up</p> <p><b>What you can expect :</b></p> <p>• Chris, along with other members of the GDG Cloud team, will be on hand to help you in case you ran into problems with the tutorial.

Built on a best-in-class machine learning engine, Ravelin delivers accurate results for merchants who want to move past manual review and antiquated fraud prevention systems. The majority of their engineering problems revolve around trying to ask complex questions of their clients data with rapid response times. To accomplish this they use BigQuery as their source of truth and their other data stores (BigTable, ElasticSearch, Redis and a bespoke graph database to name a few) are used to access data quickly. All these data stores beyond BigQuery are treated more like a cache than a persistent store and can be rebuilt from BigQuery at any time. Jono will briefly discuss how and why they do this and why the concept alone is almost as important as the implementation.</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1494069449000,"duration":7200000,"id":"239776319","name":"6: GDG Cloud London General Talks","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1498757400000,"local_date":"2017-06-29","local_time":"18:30","updated":1498777891000,"utc_offset":3600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":88,"venue":{"id":24323806,"name":"Campus London","lat":51.52259826660156,"lon":-0.08551499992609024,"repinned":false,"address_1":"4-5 Bonhill Street","city":"London EC2A 4BX","country":"gb","localized_country_name":"United Kingdom"},"group":{"created":1452675148000,"name":"GDG Cloud London","id":19331544,"join_mode":"open","lat":51.5099983215332,"lon":-0.07000000029802322,"urlname":"gdgcloud","who":"Developers","localized_location":"London, United Kingdom","state":"17","country":"gb","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/London"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdgcloud/events/239776319/","description":"<p><b>General Monthly Meetup of GDG Cloud London for June 2017. <br/></b></p> <p><b>You must have an RSVP for entry and is first come first served. </b></p> <p><b>1) Barbara Fusinska - </b>a Data Solution Architect with strong software development background.

After the session, attendees will have the practical opportunity to use TensorFlow to build deep networks, train them and evaluate the results.</p> <p><b>2) </b><b>Jon Bretman</b> - Director of Engineering at <a href=\"https://www.echo.co.uk\">Echo</a>, a product that helps people manage their repeat prescriptions. Previous to his current role he was an Engineering Manager at <a href=\"https://www.lyst.com\">Lyst</a>, the fashion e-commerce aggregator. He has spent much of the last five years working with Python and JavaScript building both front end applications and backend systems.</p> <p>This is a talk about migrating a suite of applications from App Engine to Container Engine using Kubernetes. It will cover what motivated this move in the first place, how they actually made the migration, and what they learnt during the process. Jon will talk in detail about how they decided to manage secrets, cron jobs, and deployments, and what their future plans are for their Kubernetes architecture.</p> <p><b>More speakers to be announced.</b></p> <p><b>Agenda:</b></p> <p>18:20 - Check the names at entrance</p> <p>18:30 - Begin and intros</p> <p>18:40 - Talks</p> <p>20:00 - Pizza/ Drinks</p> <p>--</p> <p>Please RSVP here to confirm your attendance as we have limited seats for this event.

The lack in connecting its component systems, which depend upon the other, often makes city utilities and services operate sub-optimally, limiting the creation of new value-added services, increasing transport costs, damaging existing logistics chains and economic models. Digital technologies offer a new wave of opportunities to mitigate some of these impacts and create a balance between social, environmental and economic opportunities that will be delivered through smart city planning, design, and construction.</p> <p>Larissa will navigate you through the fascinating world of smart cities and data as infrastructure, and will demonstrate the importance of establishing connections to enable system-of-systems integration. She will demonstrate the importance of bringing both technology and non-technology components together to create a sustainable and integrated data infrastructures and marketplaces for cities. You will hear pro-tips on data infrastructures, business strategies, and how to design for cross domain data integration. She will show real world examples that illustrated how smart cities design can be used to support intelligent decisions in the urban environment and provide unprecedented opportunities to solve social problems.</p> <p><b>Speaker 2 - Ju Liu</b><b>- </b><b>Predicting Titanic Survivors with Machine Learning</b></p> <p>What's a better way to understand machine learning than a practical example? And who hasn't watched the 1997 classic with Jack and Rose? In this talk we will first take a look at some real historical data of the event. Then we will use amazing Python libraries to live code several of the most well known algorithms. This will help us understand some fundamental concepts of how machine learning works. When we're done, you should have a good mental framework to make sense of it in the modern world.</p> <p><b><br/></b></p> <p><b>More speakers to be announced.</b></p> <p><b>Agenda:</b></p> <p>18:20 - Check the names at entrance</p> <p>18:30 - Begin and intros</p> <p>18:40 - Talks</p> <p>20:00 - Pizza/ Beers/ Drinks/ Ice cream</p> <p>--</p> <p>Please RSVP here to confirm your attendance as we have limited seats for this event.

You can speak to her in Portuguese, English, Italian and and a little of Japanese. More info on her <a href=\"http://amanda.ml\">personal website</a>. </p> <p>We will learn how to get started with building conversational bots using Actions on Google, that allows you to extend the Google Assistant to create your own Conversation Actions, integrate Google Assistant support into your services in your real world.</p> <p>--</p> <p>Actions on Google lets you build for the Google Assistant. </p> <p>Your integrations can help you engage users through Google Home today, and in the future, through Pixel, Allo, and many other experiences where the Google Assistant will be available.</p> <p>Conversation Actions help you fulfill user requests by letting you have a two-way dialog with users. When users request an action, the Google Assistant processes this request, determines the best action to invoke, and invokes your Conversation Action if relevant. From there, your action manages the rest, including how users are greeted, how to fulfill the user's request, and how the conversation ends.</p> <p>-- </p> <p>You must have an RSVP for entry and is first come first served. </p> <p>Please RSVP here to confirm your attendance as we have limited seats for this event.

She is passionate about all things data and using new and emerging technologies to deliver data focused solutions with Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Previous to Elastacloud, Bianca was a Technical Evangelist at Microsoft, working with various organisations to help them improve or architect their cloud solutions and support them in implementing Machine Learning and analytics services.</p> <p>Machine Learning is the new hype and it is marketed as if it can solve all your problems, discover insights out of the box and predict the future. Machine Learning is not magic. Machine Learning has its limitations and its beauty, but it all comes down to data and questions. You need good data and the right questions and then you are good to go. In this session, we are going to look at a typical machine learning process and how to apply it to some real-world data using Google Cloud Platform services such as Cloud Datalab and Cloud Machine Learning Engine.</p> <p>2) Amanda Cavallaro is a software developer, passionate about Cloud technologies, Human-Computer Interactions and Chatbots. She works at resolver.co.uk and is one of the Women Techmakers Leads in London and Community Organiser at GDG Cloud London. You can speak to her in Portuguese, English, Italian and a little of Japanese. We can interact with the virtual assistant for many reasons; to google search via voice, play music, execute commands, run different apps created by other developers and they can also be integrated with other platforms and devices.

Currently, she is a digital nomad, travelling around while she is doing talks and connecting with the local tech communities. While she was on the road she created DMode Labs: a software agency that promotes diversity and remote working.<br/>Besides a software developer, she is a mentor and coding teacher passionate to communicate and teach wherever she goes.<br/>In this opportunity she will talk about Firebase Predictions: the latest feature of Firebase that uses Analytics and Machine Learning to grow your app in the market!</p> <p>2) Cheuk</p> <p>Title: Launch Jupyter to the Cloud</p> <p>Abstract: Sometimes our own machine does not have enough computing power and capacity for a specific job. Say what if I want to utilize the GCP GPU to train a complex deep learning model? You can set up a \"super power machine\" on cloud and have it \"always-on\" but we only need it for a certain period of time. It make sense to shut it down when we finish and set it up again next time, may be for another job in a different scale.</p> <p>Setting up a working environment for Data Science could be tough. Manually installing every single package and library needed to transform data into useful information is tedious. As an introduction to those with no or less cloud experience, this talk will demonstrate how to set up a scale-able and reproducible environment running Jupyter Notebook on GCP using Terraform and Docker.</p> <p>Bio:</p> <p>After spending 5 years doing research in theoretical physics at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Cheuk has transferred her analytical and logical skills in natural science and built a career in Data Science. Cheuk is now a Data Scientist in Hotelbeds Groups which is one of the biggest worldwide wholesaler in travel business.</p> <p>Cheuk has also actively contribute to the community by giving AI and deep learning workshops, being a guest speaker of Department for Continuing Education in University of Oxford, contribute to open source projects like Pandas, Gensim and Dateutil. Believing in gender equality, Cheuk is currently a co-organizer of AI club for Gender Minorities to support Tech Diversity and Inclusion.</p> <p>3)Jason P Berryman<br/>GDPR compliance and the Data Loss Prevention API<br/>With the deadline for GDPR fast approaching, we'll be looking at essentials around compliance with the GDPR and how you can use Google Cloud's Data Loss Prevention API to redact/obfuscate data. In the following session, on Cloud Functions, we'll be using the DLP API to redact information stored in Cloud Firestore.</p> <p>Jason P Berryman, Founder, and CTO, Dolphin ONE Communications</p> <p>Dolphin ONE was one of the official launch partners for Cloud Firestore, working closely with the Firebase team for almost 12 months before the launch. Focusing on solutions using Google Cloud technologies, Jason has been designing and developing the Calll.io telephony platform, which uses Cloud Firestore and Cloud Functions for Firebase. at its core.</p> <p>➡️ Food requirement and suggestions here (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfSHFVA1HWtVPWq9pYv-7pdhxZ5RqeVwDGSqnusoUZepgs-xQ/viewform\" class=\"linkified\">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfSHFVA1HWtVPWq9pYv-7pdhxZ5RqeVwDGSqnusoUZepgs-xQ/viewform</a>). ⬅️</p> <p>Agenda:</p> <p>18:00 - 18:30 - Check the names at the entrance</p> <p>18:30 - Networking + Food and beverages + Birthday cake for Amanda (organiser)!</p> <p>19:00 - Tensor Flow Micro Presentations + talks</p> <p>--</p> <p>Please RSVP here to confirm your attendance as we have limited seats for this event.

Which solution should you choose to deploy with Kubernetes, and why?</p> <p>This talk compares and contrasts the most popular solutions, and lays out the eight principles for cloud native storage.</p> <p>Cheryl Hung is an ex-Google software engineer, now product manager at StorageOS. She codes, writes and speaks about storage, containers and cloud infrastructure. She holds a Masters in Computer Science from the University of Cambridge.</p> <p>Cheryl was the first Cloud Native Computing Foundation Ambassador in the UK and founder of the Cloud Native London meetup. She is a nominee for Rising Stars in Technology 2018.</p> <p>2) If you’ve visited our Codelabs area, either in person at an event like Google I/O or online (g.co/codelabs), you’ve seen our collection of over 500 coding tutorials on Google developer technology. In this session, I'll go behind the scenes to show you the tools and techniques we use to author, publish, and maintain these resources. I’ll also share the open source software and knowledge you’ll need to author your own codelabs and publish your own site. Finally, I'll review some of my favorite interactive learning tools and reflect on where this technology is going.</p> <p>Marc Cohen - I build tools, demos, codelabs, and other things to make the Google Cloud Platform easier and more fun to use. Originally from New Jersey, then Seattle, and now live and work in London. I co-authored a book about Google Compute Engine and wrote the product announcement demo. In a previous life, I developed communication systems at Bell Labs and Lucent Technologies. Outside of work, I enjoy indie music, quirky films (especially documentaries), books, puzzles, and chess. I'm also very interested in education, teaching, and applying technology (like spaced repetition) to enhance the learning experience.</p> <p>3) We'll be taking a look at Google Cloud's new WaveNet powered Cloud Text-to-Speech API and how you can build interactive voice application.</p> <p>Jason is a Firebase GDE and launch partner for Google Cloud products, such as Cloud Firestore and Cloud Text-to-Speech. He develops voice applications using SIP and WebRTC, driven by various Google Cloud technologies.</p> <p>----</p> <p>➡️ Food requirement and suggestions here (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfSHFVA1HWtVPWq9pYv-7pdhxZ5RqeVwDGSqnusoUZepgs-xQ/viewform\" class=\"linkified\">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfSHFVA1HWtVPWq9pYv-7pdhxZ5RqeVwDGSqnusoUZepgs-xQ/viewform</a>). ⬅️</p> <p>Agenda:</p> <p>18:20 - 18:30 - Check the names at the entrance</p> <p>18:40 - Begin and intros</p> <p>- Talks</p> <p>20:00 - Snacks, beverages &amp; Networking</p> <p>----</p> <p>Please RSVP here to confirm your attendance as we have limited seats for this event.

But does that mean you need to be a DevOps expert? Security researchers today need to discover new attack techniques. However, much of their focus diverges to backend coding. We share how to build an infrastructure for researchers that allows them to concentrate on business logic and writing hacker “tasks”. Using Docker and Kubernetes on Google Cloud, these tasks can then be performed in parallel and without a lot of DevOps hassle.

We can interact with the google assistant for many reasons; to google search via voice, play music, execute commands, run different apps created by other developers and they can also be integrated with other platforms and devices...and build your own apps!</p> <p>What is this event about?<br/>Part of a global event series that is supported by Google Developers and the Assistant Team. This one event of a series, there will be another one!</p> <p>Agenda</p> <p>@chibichibibr - Overview to Actions for the Google Assistant<br/>Amanda Cavallaro is a software developer, passionate about Cloud technologies, Human-Computer Interactions and Chatbots. During the day she works at resolver.co.uk, when the sun goes down she wears her cape of Google Developer Expert for Google Assistant and is a Women Techmakers Lead and Community Organiser at GDG Cloud London. You can speak to her in Portuguese, English, Italian and a little of Japanese. You can find more info about her on her website: amanda.ml. She</p> <p>will host a talk on how to get started with building conversational bots using Actions on Google, that allows you to extend the Google Assistant to create your own Conversation Actions, integrate Google Assistant support into your services in your real world.</p> <p>@ElizaCamber - *Taking your agent to the next level\"<br/>Eliza is an Android developer at Pixplicity in the Netherlands, and the WomenTechmakers lead and a GDG organizer for the Dutch chapters. She’s also a speaker in many tech conferences for community, Android and conversational apps topics. Her studies were on Robotics and Automation Engineering.</p> <p>The last 2 years Google made it clear that its virtual assistant is here not just to stay but to change completely the way we interact with our devices. But engaging your users has never been more difficult. Without a graphic UI to wow your users, the solution is to design a helpful, intelligent and fun agent. As trivial as it may sound, standing out with a conversational app is certainly not an easy feat! During this talk we will explore how we can design a better agent by not falling into some pitfalls, how to customize our agent for each user but also for each platform and how to add payment transactions for maximum user engagement and efficiency.</p> <p>Codelabs led by @frapontillo.

She designed DeepAsteroid, a Neural net architecture able to predict asteroids impact on earth . The project was selected among the 25th most innovative in the world and in between the 5th of the best use of data in NASA Space Apps Challenge 2016 and selected as one of the cases of use for Tensorflow in Google I/O 2017. She currently contributes to several open source projects having machine learning at their core.<br/>More at <a href=\"https://github.com/soygema\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/soygema</a></p> <p>2) Did you know you have superpowers? The average person now has access to more data and more powerful tools and computing resources for analyzing that data than ever before in human history. In this tutorial, I'll show you how to combine Google cloud services (like Dataprep, Dataflow, BigQuery, and Data Studio), along with modern Python tools to analyze and visualize some interesting and practical questions (for example, What makes people happy? and Analyzing web trends from the HTTP Archive). You'll leave this session with a better sense of how much data analytic power is available right at your fingertips.</p> <p>*Marc Cohen* - I build tools, demos, codelabs, and other things to make the Google Cloud Platform easier and more fun to use. Originally from New Jersey, then Seattle, and now live and work in London. I co-authored a book about Google Compute Engine and wrote the product announcement demo. In a previous life, I developed communication systems at Bell Labs and Lucent Technologies. Outside of work, I enjoy indie music, quirky films (especially documentaries), books, puzzles, and chess. I'm also very interested in education, teaching, and applying technology (like spaced repetition) to enhance the learning experience.</p> <p>3) Let's go serverless with Cloud Functions for Firebase<br/>Just add code. We'll take a look at how Cloud Functions can be used to create fully managed, scalable, on-demand microservices, to transform data, manipulate images / audio or connect to 3rd party APIs.</p> <p>*Jason* is a Firebase GDE and launch partner for Google Cloud products, such as Cloud Firestore and Cloud Text-to-Speech. He develops voice applications using SIP and WebRTC, driven by various Google Cloud technologies.<br/>----</p> <p>➡️ Food requirement and suggestions here (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfSHFVA1HWtVPWq9pYv-7pdhxZ5RqeVwDGSqnusoUZepgs-xQ/viewform\" class=\"linkified\">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfSHFVA1HWtVPWq9pYv-7pdhxZ5RqeVwDGSqnusoUZepgs-xQ/viewform</a>). ⬅️</p> <p>Agenda:</p> <p>18:30 - 18:50 - Check the names at the entrance, snacks and drinks.</p> <p>19:00 - Talks.</p> <p>20:15 - Networking, drinks, pizza, sweets and snacks.</p> <p>----</p> <p>Please RSVP here to confirm your attendance as we have limited seats for this event.

Humans learn from the environment by obtaining positive or negative rewards when we execute our actions in the environment. This means that our behaviors are modified based on those rewards. In this talk I will describe how reinforcement learning works in a theoretical way; which are the typical and most used algorithms; when we can use it and how to use it with TensorFlow describing how to built a agent that uses reinforcement learning in order to solve a specific problem.</p> <p>I am Moisés Martínez and I am Ph.D. in the field of Artificial Intelligence working as researcher at Kings College of London (specializing in Classical Planning, Machine Learning and Robotic Systems). Research, Data scientist, T3chFest Organizer (Spain), speaker and meetups lover. You can reach me on Twitter as @moisipm.</p> <p>2) Greeting people with Voice and Vision ML</p> <p>How will the world look when computers can easily recognize you and greet you when you arrive? What are easily possible now with the cloud tools? I will show how I made it work and what I learned using Google Cloud new machine learning tools and how easy they are. We will also talk about what is missing from the tools and what can we look forward to in the future.</p> <p>Kevin Simper is a Google Cloud Community Organiser in Copenhagen and organizes CopenhagenJS.

With TensorFlow, combined with the scalability of Google’s Cloud Machine Learning Engine, now anyone can leverage deep learning technology at low cost and without much expertise. We will explore examples of business that have adopted TensorFlow and Cloud ML to solve their real-world problems: a cucumber farmer in Japan who was able to build a deep learning-based cucumber sorter by himself, a used car auction service using TF for classifying car models and parts, and a food manufacturer that has been able to increase productivity significantly in their baby food factory.</p> <p>Speaker 2)<br/>Description: Bring your laptops and join us as we build an Action using Actions on Google &amp; Dialogflow that is ready to deploy!

He has been a Site Reliability Engineer at Google since 2014. His interests, hobbies and personal traits are not something he'd like to disclose in a public bio, but he'll be happy to tell you his secret to good scrambled eggs.</p> <p>Florian's bio: Florian defected from academia after a PhD in computational science at Imperial to build data pipelines for meteorological data at the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) for 3 years before joining Google as a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) on Google Cloud. At evenings and weekends he cycles to many more meetups than is healthy and works hard to make tech more inclusive for all.</p> <p>3) Setting up an environment for Machine Learning (Tensorflow) on GCP<br/>Speaker:<br/>Steve started as a developer, and moved into system architecture, business analysis and project management (Microsoft Office 365 stack), but still likes to tinker at home with hardware and all things Google.</p> <p>Steve is over in the UK, from Australia (he is originally from the UK, and studied in London), and offered to present at the GDG London.</p> <p>He is switching to another direction in IT, that of Machine Learning, and has just graduated from the Udacity course 'Deep Learning'.</p> <p>He has grappled with various methods to deliver the practical coursework, and will present a quick way to set up a machine learning environment with most of the required tools (such as Tensorflow) on GCP using GCP Marketplace, and how to modify the server to use the latest GPU to accelerate model training.</p> ","how_to_find_us":"www.twitter.com/gdgcloud","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1538307882000,"duration":7200000,"id":"255136570","name":"London Firebase Day","rsvp_limit":80,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1541444400000,"local_date":"2018-11-05","local_time":"19:00","updated":1542768247000,"utc_offset":0,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":80,"venue":{"id":24430752,"name":"Google Office","lat":51.516056060791016,"lon":-0.12714800238609314,"repinned":true,"address_1":"1–13 St. Giles High Street, London, WC2H 8AG","city":"London","country":"gb","localized_country_name":"United Kingdom"},"group":{"created":1452675148000,"name":"GDG Cloud London","id":19331544,"join_mode":"open","lat":51.5099983215332,"lon":-0.07000000029802322,"urlname":"gdgcloud","who":"Developers","localized_location":"London, United Kingdom","state":"17","country":"gb","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/London"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdgcloud/events/255136570/","manual_attendance_count":64,"description":"<p>With GDG Cloud London we are hosting an entire event dedicated to *Firebase*.<br/>Directly after the Firebase Summit we are gonna bring the news related to this platform and we have a surprise: James Daniels, developers relations from Google and Firebase team is gonna be our special guest.<br/>Firebase swag is gonna be provided!</p> <p>Agenda:</p> <p>18:45 Registration<br/>19:00 Keynote: Review from Firebase Summit 2018 by Firebase Google Developer Experts Jason Berryman and Laura Morinigo<br/>19:15 Hands On with Cloud Functions and more by James Daniels</p> ","how_to_find_us":"Location is gonna be in Google Offices Covent Garden!

Knative provides a better choice. Knative extends Kubernetes to provide a set of middleware components (build, serving, events) for modern, source-centric, and container-based apps that can run anywhere. In this talk, we’ll see how we can use Knative primitives to build a serverless app that utilizes the Machine Learning magic of the cloud.</p> <p>Bio (Mete): Mete is a Developer Advocate at Google, focused on helping developers with Google Cloud. As a long-time Java and C# developer, he likes to compare the two ecosystems. Prior to Google, he worked at Microsoft, Skype, Adobe, EMC, and Nokia building apps and services on various web, mobile and cloud platforms. Originally from the island of Cyprus, he currently lives in Greenwich of London, not too far away from the prime meridian.</p> <p>Jason Berryman<br/>Title: Serverless with Firebase</p> <p>Talk:<br/>You have a great idea for an app. You just want to start building it, not spend months building database servers, APIs and managing sharding, replication, backups, etc. I'll be showing how the Firebase \"BackEnd-as-a-Service\" can get you up and running in minutes, rather than months.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Jason is a freelance consultant and a Google Developers Expert.

Building state-of-the-art Computer Vision models is within anyone’s reach thanks to the high availability of open-source research, online support, user-friendly high-level APIs and ready-to-use pre-trained models. But how do you put a Computer Vision model into production and serve it in a real-life application?<br/>Sam will walk us through an effective Object Detection built on GCP for one of Datatonic’s clients. The solution uses TensorFlow Object Detection API, ML Engine, Cloud Composer and Cloud Functions to identify stories on screenshots of news websites, automatically re-train the models and create annotation boxes for new data as it lands on GCS. This talk will give you a great example of how to effectively design an ML pipeline on Google Cloud.</p> <p>Biography<br/>Samantha is a Machine Learning Engineer at Datatonic, a team of data problem solvers working on cutting-edge Machine Learning solutions in the fields of Media, Telecom and Retail.</p> <p>3) Cheryl Hung: Navigating the cloud-native ecosystem for end users</p> <p>Description<br/>As Director of Ecosystem at the CNCF, my mission is to foster the End User community, ensure end-users' voices are well represented and ultimately, that organizations can adopt cloud native successfully.</p> <p>Through 45 interviews conducted in December 2018, I found that end users face three broad challenges:</p> <p>* Solving an immediate technical need</p> <p>* Growing an engineering team</p> <p>* Building business strategy around cloud-native</p> <p>I will describe how to overcome these challenges with the help of the CNCF, and the CNCF's strategy for end users in 2019.</p> <p>Attendees will learn how to participate in and contribute to the cloud native community, and how to be good open source citizens.</p> <p>Biography</p> <p>Cheryl Hung (@oicheryl) is the Director of Ecosystem at the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, part of the Linux Foundation. Her mission is to increase the adoption of Kubernetes and cloud native by advocating for end users.

Pretty simple stuff but often the simple issues can be the trickiest.</p> <p>I will show how running a simple cloud-composer pipeline can get out of hand very quickly. Specifically, we will analyse a pipeline generating 100,000 of tasks and few strategies on how to make it more manageable, reliable and understandable.</p> <p>✨Bio: I am an Italian by birth but a citizen of the world by choice.</p> <p>After a couple of years spent in exotic locations around the world doing research on network measurement and security, I decided to apply my experience to build new and better Linux technologies in Berlin.</p> <p>Now I juggle terabytes of data and billions of events into the Cloud in London at Huq Industries.</p> <p>Huq is a market research company focusing on geolocation data. At Huq, we directly collect events from the real world and transform them into insights for many different markets including finance, outdoor media and property development.</p> <p>Huq Industries’ proprietary dataset and methodologies offers on-demand access to hard-to-reach consumer trends and behaviours.

The process took about four months and 200 TiB of storage. Record-breaking Pi calculations have traditionally been done on supercomputers and special-made hardware, but we did it on Cloud for the first time. This talk will discuss the nature of the calculation, the architecture, challenges and techniques, and of course the brief history of Pi computation. Calculating Pi has been the speaker's childhood dream and this talk will also explain how the small dream grew to the new world record.</p> <p>----</p> <p>➡️ Food requirement and suggestions here (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfSHFVA1HWtVPWq9pYv-7pdhxZ5RqeVwDGSqnusoUZepgs-xQ/viewform\" class=\"linkified\">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfSHFVA1HWtVPWq9pYv-7pdhxZ5RqeVwDGSqnusoUZepgs-xQ/viewform</a>). ⬅️</p> <p>Agenda:</p> <p>18:20 -

I will use my own experiences as a valid example of how the process of providing relevant, up to date opportunities for young people from underprivileged backgrounds to break into tech. Millions are invested in building new, innovative technologies. But how is this investment is used to improve existing, outdated processes across industries? Is it really being used to change perhaps the most outdated aspect of society: the continued existence of poverty?</p> <p>Bio: Futuristic, entrepreneurial, brimful with energy, a keen innovator and idea generator. As the founder of a social impact start-up, Edify, providing digital skills training to deprived West London areas, Melissa’s determined to build a world where the quality of tech education and access to innovation and the more future-facing careers is not dependent on geographical location.

Am I happy? Is this success? What did I do right? What did I do wrong? What I wish I could have done differently? Have I got something to share with others? Can I inspire others? What is next?<br/>In this keynote I go over my journey and share a number of reflections that would probably be of interest to dreamers, achievers, hard-workers and change-makers.<br/>---<br/>Professor Paolo Taticchi is Principal Teaching Fellow in Management &amp; Sustainability (professorial) and Executive Director of Global Student Experience at Imperial College Business School.<br/>He teaches modules on sustainability and competitive advantage, strategy, global operations and projects, and the future of cities.

Yet, integrating provisioned resources with services deployed on K8s still require glue code and automation.<br/>I've recently been researching Config Connector, which allows Google Cloud resources to be managed as a set of Custom Resource Definitions. By integrating infrastructure-defining CRDs in custom Helm charts, it is possible to tie the lifecycle of cloud resources to the app making use of them, reducing the need for extra code. It also allows teams to more easily specify requirements for a new service in a single file/language.<br/>---<br/>Lorenzo has been working as a SRE for the last year, developing and maintaining an internal platform based on GCP and Kubernetes for his company, Oddschecker.<br/>He has a background as software developer and likes to experiment with new technology.<br/>LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lorenzoturrino/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/lorenzoturrino/</a><br/>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/robota-x\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/robota-x</a></p> <p>Please RSVP here to confirm your attendance as we have limited seats for this event.

We will start with demonstrating such trade-offs and design principles by asking simple questions as “which car would you buy?” and \"What will your answer be if you have 1000$? 10M$, Would you buy the same car? Will it affect your decision If you driving 10 mins a day? 10 hours a day? Together we will cover the key points and questions you should consider when architecting your solution.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Ayelet is a strategic cloud engineer @Google UK, focusing on infrastructure, AppDev, and SRE.
