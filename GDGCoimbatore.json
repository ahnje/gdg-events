India, home to over a million developers is openly embracing the power of AI across sectors, from health care, education, governance to the economic and cultural well-being of the country.<br/>To empower this journey, Google has joined hands with Niti Ayog to grow the AI ecosystem in India, by training developers, mentoring students and providing research grants to universities across the country. Contributing to this larger idea of building an “AI empowered India”, Google has launched Machine Learning (ML) Study Jam Series from June 1st to end of 2018 with the aim to enable a platform to learn for ML enthusiasts.</p> <p>ML Study Jams are a series of free, community run, in-person study groups where participants learn, network and build ML solutions to tackle India specific challenges together. The primary goal of Study Jams is to raise the technical proficiency of participants in ML. These participants will leverage the Machine Learning Crash Course and TensorFlow Tutorials developed by Google as the main curriculum to deliver in their study jams.</p> <p>The detailed agenda of topics we are going to cover:</p> <p>Day 1 - Dec 21</p> <p>9:30 AM Registration &amp; GDG Coimbatore Intro By GDG Team<br/>10:00 AM to 10:30 AM Keynote By Pratyusha Simharaja (Video Call)<br/>10:30 AM to 01:00 PM Python and 3rd Party Libraries By Mohamedsipli<br/>02:00 PM to 04:30 PM ML Algorithms By Mohamedsipli</p> <p>Day 2 - Dec 22</p> <p>10:00 AM to 01:00 PM Tensorflow and Neural Network By Mohamedsipli<br/>02:00 PM to 04:30 PM Web Scraping and NLP By Mohamedsipli</p> <p>Day 3 - Dec 23</p> <p>10:00 AM to 11:00 PM ML for Mobile By Harshit Dwivedi (Video Call)<br/>11:00 PM to 01:00 PM ML for Web By Mohamedsipli<br/>02:00 PM to 04:30 PM Advanced ML and AI By Mohamedsipli.<br/>4.30 Thank you Note.</p> <p>Speakers:<br/>1.
