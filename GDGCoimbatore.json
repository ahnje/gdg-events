India, home to over a million developers is openly embracing the power of AI across sectors, from health care, education, governance to the economic and cultural well-being of the country.<br/>To empower this journey, Google has joined hands with Niti Ayog to grow the AI ecosystem in India, by training developers, mentoring students and providing research grants to universities across the country. Contributing to this larger idea of building an “AI empowered India”, Google has launched Machine Learning (ML) Study Jam Series from June 1st to end of 2018 with the aim to enable a platform to learn for ML enthusiasts.</p> <p>ML Study Jams are a series of free, community run, in-person study groups where participants learn, network and build ML solutions to tackle India specific challenges together. The primary goal of Study Jams is to raise the technical proficiency of participants in ML. These participants will leverage the Machine Learning Crash Course and TensorFlow Tutorials developed by Google as the main curriculum to deliver in their study jams.</p> <p>The detailed agenda of topics we are going to cover:</p> <p>Day 1 - Dec 21</p> <p>9:30 AM Registration &amp; GDG Coimbatore Intro By GDG Team<br/>10:00 AM to 10:30 AM Keynote By Pratyusha Simharaja (Video Call)<br/>10:30 AM to 01:00 PM Python and 3rd Party Libraries By Mohamedsipli<br/>02:00 PM to 04:30 PM ML Algorithms By Mohamedsipli</p> <p>Day 2 - Dec 22</p> <p>10:00 AM to 01:00 PM Tensorflow and Neural Network By Mohamedsipli<br/>02:00 PM to 04:30 PM Web Scraping and NLP By Mohamedsipli</p> <p>Day 3 - Dec 23</p> <p>10:00 AM to 11:00 PM ML for Mobile By Harshit Dwivedi (Video Call)<br/>11:00 PM to 01:00 PM ML for Web By Mohamedsipli<br/>02:00 PM to 04:30 PM Advanced ML and AI By Mohamedsipli.<br/>4.30 Thank you Note.</p> <p>Speakers:<br/>1.

The countdown begins ladies and gentlemen. Watch out this space for more updates.</p> <p>An award function for the first time in the history of Google's WTM(Women TechMakers).<br/>On this 2020 IWD (International Women's Day), *Google's WTM Coimbatore* would like to take a minute to wish every woman who is always been a multitasking person, a very happy Women's day.</p> <p>IWD WTM Awards 2020 is a recognition for all the women who have contributed in any technical field in Coimbatore. For instance, a woman who has started a technology startup or the CEO of a big company in Cbe. But to make it little interesting, we will not be giving the awards to the women directly, instead, the men who have supported the women and encouraged them to come all the way to where they are today will be recognized and awarded. The man behind the woman can be a father, husband or friend.
