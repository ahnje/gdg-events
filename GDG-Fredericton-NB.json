Learn how to do that with Firebase! Join us for our Firebase Study Jam! Together we'll work through Firebase for web codelabs prepared by Google instructors. You will be able to get hands-on experience with Firebase</p> <p>Our Speaker: Simon Gauvin</p> <p>Simon Gauvin is an expert in the field of Web Development, mobile and cloud computing with 25 years of experience developing several startup software companies. He was former VP of Applications Technology at Plazmic Inc. (acquired by RIM in 2002) where he led the development of a mobile media platform for Warner Brothers and Disney in the Japanese mobile market. He completed Ph.D. research in Computer Science at Dalhousie University and has been published in several leading academic journals. Simon has authored software patents, invented and developed several new programming languages, and used this work to co-found Vizwik.com, a visual programming mobile app development platform. He recently co-founded another startup, Safelii Inc., which is using mobile and AI technology to help improve health and safety services for employees in corporations. He is also a freelance Chief Technology Officer consulting for small to medium-sized companies in Atlantic Canada.</p> <p>Design Patterns with web components and Firebase<br/>In this presentation, we will demonstrate various software design patterns that simplify the building of Web Apps using Web Components and Firestore. We present patterns for application design with respect to Authentication, View Management, Data Abstraction, and Application Architecture. We also present patterns that assist the backend development for Realtime Database, Firestore, and Storage management. These patterns are presented in the context of several real-world applications with code samples. Participants' knowledge of JavaScript is required, Familiarity with Polymer and Firebase APIs is not required, but would be an asset.</p> <p>With a Firebase Study Jam, you will learn the capabilities of using Firebase for developing Web applications, share their experiences, and solve hands-on problems together. Firebase Study Jams are a great opportunity to meet with your community to learn this hot technology in person.</p> <p>Join a community of like-minded developers and explore the latest Firebase for Web technologies as a team.</p> <p>Attend with your laptop (PC, Mac or Chromebook)!<br/>The labs will run on all of the latest versions of popular browsers.<br/>For the best experience check out Get Started with Firebase for Web.</p> ","how_to_find_us":"http://meet.google.com/uio-rhgz-cvb","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false}],"upcoming":[],"organizers":[{"id":171010622,"name":"Pragith P.","bio":"Data Scientist & DevOps Enthusiast\n\n7+ years of exp in building and automating data products using R & Python and deploying them in the Cloud.
