During this study jam, we shall be learning the best practices in mobile site development which in turn will help improve the general standard of mobile design and speed, and support the growth of the Google community in Iraq.</p> <p>Today, over 50% of web traffic goes to mobile yet developers aren’t designing effectively for mbole e.g. 53% of mobile visitors will leave if a page takes more than three seconds to load. The average page takes 19 seconds to load over 3G. Speed is just one part of creating better mobile experiences and best practice has gone a long way past responsive design alone. Are you up to date?</p> <p>Requirements</p> <p>You need basic web development skills to take part and it typically it takes 3-4 hours to run through the course materials, followed by a 90 minute multiple choice exam. You can find more details on the course here (<a href=\"https://support.google.com/partners/answer/7358898?hl=en-GB&amp;ref_topic=7359299\" class=\"linkified\">https://support.google.com/partners/answer/7358898?hl=en-GB&amp;ref_topic=7359299</a>). It’s possible to do it entirely online alone, but we’d like to run through it together as a group and support each other for this first study jam.</p> <p>This is a chance to get a professional accreditation that demonstrates you have an understanding of basic and advanced aspects of mobile website design and development. By learning together, we are growing the developer community in Iraq and you'll have the chance to meet like-minded individuals!</p> <p>Why do it?</p> <p>There is more traffic to mobile sites than desktop, yet most sites don’t provide an effective experience for users. Best practice is changing rapidly so what people may have learned a few years ago may not be up to date. For companies and site owners we see better mobile design leading to significant and measurable improvements in customer acquisition, retention and engagement (<a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/showcase\" class=\"linkified\">https://developers.google.com/web/showcase</a>).</p> <p>The Mobile Sites certification is a professional accreditation that Google offers to individuals who demonstrate proficiency in basic and advanced aspects of mobile website design and development. A Mobile Sites certification allows individuals to demonstrate that Google recognizes them as an expert in mobile sites.</p> <p>Benefits include:</p> <p>• Certificate: Show that you're a certified mobile sites professional with a personalized certificate that you can print!</p> <p>• Profile page: Share your expertise with a Google Partners public profile page that lists your certifications.</p> <p>Developers that participate in the study jam and complete the exam will then become a certified mobile sites professional.</p> <p>VENUE: MSELECT, Behind Hawler Hospital, 100m road</p> <p>• What to bring<br/>Laptop, pen, and notepad</p> ","how_to_find_us":"Come inside the building and up the stairs to the first floor","visibility":"public"},{"created":1516719577000,"duration":14400000,"id":"247086027","name":"IWD: Women in Tech and Entrepreneurship Summit - Sulaymaniyah","rsvp_limit":100,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1523093400000,"local_date":"2018-04-07","local_time":"12:30","updated":1523262892000,"utc_offset":10800000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":12,"venue":{"id":25704811,"name":"The American University of Iraq Sulaimani (AUIS)","lat":35.5761604309082,"lon":45.33962631225586,"repinned":false,"address_1":"Sulaimani - Kirkuk Rd, Sulaimania","city":"Sulaymaniyah","country":"iq","localized_country_name":"Iraq"},"group":{"created":1513013866000,"name":"GDG and WTM Erbil","id":26845230,"join_mode":"open","lat":36.189998626708984,"lon":44.02000045776367,"urlname":"GDG-Erbil","who":"Members","localized_location":"Irbil, Iraq","state":"","country":"iq","region":"en_US","timezone":"Asia/Baghdad"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Erbil/events/247086027/","manual_attendance_count":120,"description":"<p>GET TICKETS HERE: <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/iwd-women-in-tech-summit-sulaymaniyah-tickets-39911107196\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/iwd-women-in-tech-summit-sulaymaniyah-tickets-39911107196</a></p> <p>• What we'll do</p> <p>PANEL DISCUSSION: 1pm-2.30pm</p> <p>In celebration of International Women's Day, the Women in Tech and Entrepreneurship Summit is designed to bring together inspiring female leaders and innovators to explore opportunities for women in technology and entrepreneurship in Iraq.
