Janice has been a software engineer for 35 years. She was 16 when she got her first programming job working in Commodore Pet basic. Janice loves the challenge of learning new technology and building beautiful software. Her current adventure is building and managing a scale testing lab, which lets her learn lots of cool new things and have a huge impact for the company's clients.<br/>She is hoping to inspire other women by discussing her career journey from coding on the first PCs, to mainframe development, then client server technology followed by Java/J2EE and these days: ruby, powershell, vmware, and oracle database performance tuning.<br/>She has been very fortunate in her tech career to do many interesting things and to have a lot of flexibility for home and family life.</p> <p>Gretchen has been working with children and adolescents in the community for over a decade. She holds a BA in philosophy and the history of science and mathematics from St. John's College in Annapolis, and an MS in Applied Psychology from the University of Baltimore. Her work in the non-profit sector has included teaching life skills, building community and fostering self-esteem through the arts, workforce development, and career counseling. Gretchen is co-founder and executive director of Code in the Schools, a non-profit whose mission is to teach under-served and under-represented Baltimore City Students computer programming.</p> <p>Celeste Lunn<br/>is currently a college Computer Science major and the vice president of the match club of her school. Her technology experience began with working on websites of her high school, where she also managed all<br/>aspects of video and sound, did all server updates and made daily announcements. Last semester she spent abroad in The Netherlands developing and updating websites. It was an amazing experience for her.

Why is goal setting important and not just a silly task?</p> <p>People with written goals are 50% more likely to achieve them than people without goals. Goal setting and achieving them can appear as a daunting task, but it doesn't have to be. By applying some simple rules to your goal setting process you will be less likely to fail and more likely to find yourself right where you want to be. During this workshop, we will walk through several different types of goal setting and some easy steps to follow to ensure goal setting and achieving success. Your goal isn't too big for you. Your goal isn't wrong for you.

Our September even kicks off a series of workshops for Flutter. The series will be led by me, Reuben Turner (GroovinChip). Throughout the series we will be learning Flutter by getting our hands dirty with real, practical code. We will do things like tackling outstanding issues on the Flutter repository, and building real apps. We will start by learning how to install Flutter and analyzing the default Counter app. We will also have a Q&amp;A session where I will answer Flutter questions. We will also have pizza and drinks!</p> <p>Please me sure you bring a laptop!</p> <p>Parking instructions:<br/>\"We are located on the 3rd floor, above Mustang Alleys.
