The ability to achieve this becomes more complex when components scale and get distributed across a cluster and messages are not anymore in only one platform. Distributed Tracing is a mechanism to track request-bounded behaviour across different, distributed components, propagating context between them and enable traces aggregation and analyze how components behave along each transaction. Tracing, as related methods like Logging and Metrics, help us to increase the level of observability that we have around our applications.</p> <p>This presentation is aim to introduce practices to increase Observability using Logging, Metrics, and Tracing. Then, it will explain how to instrument applications with OpenTracing API and how to integrate with different tracing infrastructures like JaegerTracing and OpenZipkin. Finally, it will show some areas of study that are getting developed based on information generated by tracing.</p> <p>Speaker:<br/>Jorge Quilcate is software engineer, part of the Middleware team in Sysco AS, doing back-end development and data integration.

Både forskere, som forsøker å finne bedre måter å forebygge og kurere sykdommene våre, og helseledere, som forsøker å holde oss mest mulig friske for skattekronene vi betaler, kunne gjort en mye bedre jobb hvis de hadde bedre tilgang til helsedata.</p> <p>Er det mulig å høste forsknings og beslutningsgrunnlags -gevinstene, ved å enklere kunne sammenstille og analysere våre helsedata, uten at det går på bekostning av personvern og sikkerhet?</p> <p>Dette er problemet som Direktoratet for e-helse forsøker å løse med prosjektet Helseanalyseplattformen.

A flexible data model gives you a lot of choices, but which way is the right way?

Impact on application code will be discussed, as well as some tooling that could be helpful along the way. The examples use the free, open-source Couchbase Server document database, but the principles from this session can also be applied to CosmosDb, Mongo, RavenDb, etc.</p> <p>**Speaker:**<br/>Matthew D.

It takes discipline to use container technology. It may not be as secure nor as optimal as you thought it would be. Although it’s relatively easy to create a new immutable container image to run everywhere, you may have fallen into many of the caveats. Is it running as the root user? Why are the images taking so much space? Why did your containers run out of space in the first place!? Most importantly, your container images may not be as immutable nor repeatable as you thought, and your Java process might be overutilizing assigned resources! Attend this session to learn how to best address these issues when building your Java container images.</p> <p>**Speaker:**<br/>Ray Tsang<br/>Ray is a Developer Advocate for the Google Cloud Platform and a Java Champion.

This is possible because infrastructure has become abstracted from physical hardware., meaning it can be treated like a software system. That means you can apply Version control, Test-Driven Development, Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery to your infrastructure.</p> <p>Terraform<br/>Terraform is used to create, manage, and update infrastructure resources such as physical machines, VMs, network switches, containers, and more. Almost any infrastructure type can be represented as a resource in Terraform such as IaaS (e.g. AWS, GCP, Microsoft Azure, OpenStack), PaaS (e.g. Heroku), or even SaaS services.</p> <p>Pulumi<br/>Pulumi is a multi-language and multi-cloud development platform. It lets you create all aspects of your cloud as code in many known programming languages.
