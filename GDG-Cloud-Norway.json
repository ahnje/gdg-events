The ability to achieve this becomes more complex when components scale and get distributed across a cluster and messages are not anymore in only one platform. Distributed Tracing is a mechanism to track request-bounded behaviour across different, distributed components, propagating context between them and enable traces aggregation and analyze how components behave along each transaction. Tracing, as related methods like Logging and Metrics, help us to increase the level of observability that we have around our applications.</p> <p>This presentation is aim to introduce practices to increase Observability using Logging, Metrics, and Tracing. Then, it will explain how to instrument applications with OpenTracing API and how to integrate with different tracing infrastructures like JaegerTracing and OpenZipkin. Finally, it will show some areas of study that are getting developed based on information generated by tracing.</p> <p>Speaker:<br/>Jorge Quilcate is software engineer, part of the Middleware team in Sysco AS, doing back-end development and data integration.

A common solution to this is to allocate more compute resources, but what if we could rather allocate their resources on demand?</p> <p>In this presentation, we'll investigate one solution that utilizes Kubernetes to avoid long queues on the build server. In addition, we'll see how one can dynamically scale the Kubernetes cluster on Google Cloud Platform to reduce costs during low periods of activity, but also handle bursts in traffic in a satisfactory manner.</p> <p>Lastly, I'll share some of the experiences we've had with such a solution and some of the things you should look out for if you wish to do something similar.</p> <p>Speaker:<br/>Lars Martin Pedersen is a passionate full-stack developer that enjoys a challenge and likes to be involved in every technical part of a project.<br/>Fairly recently he was appointed the task of being responsible for Cloud OPS in his team, and he would like to share some of the insights of his experiences with you.</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1525890245000,"duration":5400000,"id":"250621175","name":"Apache Airflow og Apache Beam","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1526310000000,"local_date":"2018-05-14","local_time":"17:00","updated":1540220241000,"utc_offset":7200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":16,"venue":{"id":17454962,"name":"Teknologihuset","lat":59.9234504699707,"lon":10.731789588928223,"repinned":false,"address_1":"Pilestredet 56","city":"Oslo","country":"no","localized_country_name":"Norway"},"group":{"created":1430812793000,"name":"GDG Cloud Oslo, Norway","id":18577017,"join_mode":"open","lat":59.90999984741211,"lon":10.75,"urlname":"GDG-Cloud-Norway","who":"Members","localized_location":"Oslo, Norway","state":"","country":"no","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Oslo"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Cloud-Norway/events/250621175/","manual_attendance_count":15,"description":"<p>[This particular talk will be held in Norwegian.]</p> <p>Apache Beam er fantastisk til å gjøre transformasjoner av data, men plattformen mangler et godt scheduleringsverktøy.</p> <p>Skal man ha flere jobber, med avhengigheter til andre jobber, blir det fort mye scripting og uoversiktlig.</p> <p>I denne presentasjonen vil vi se på hvordan Apache Airflow og managed Apache Beam (Google Dataflow) kan spille på lag for å løse disse problemene.</p> <p>Eksempler og kode som blir presentert vil være i Python.</p> <p>---------<br/>Foredragsholder: Anders Elton.</p> <p>Anders Elton is a passionate full-stack developer that enjoys a challenge and likes to be involved in every technical part of a project.

På veien registreres det masse digitale helsedata om deg og meg.</p> <p>Disse dataene vil vi ikke skal komme på avveie, og derfor er de som oftest låst ned lokalt hos hvert helseforetak, med strenge krav og retningslinjer for innsyn. Dette er i utgangspunktet bra, men samtidig er helsedataene våre en gullgruve med informasjon som vi i dag ikke får brukt noe særlig. Både forskere, som forsøker å finne bedre måter å forebygge og kurere sykdommene våre, og helseledere, som forsøker å holde oss mest mulig friske for skattekronene vi betaler, kunne gjort en mye bedre jobb hvis de hadde bedre tilgang til helsedata.</p> <p>Er det mulig å høste forsknings og beslutningsgrunnlags -gevinstene, ved å enklere kunne sammenstille og analysere våre helsedata, uten at det går på bekostning av personvern og sikkerhet?</p> <p>Dette er problemet som Direktoratet for e-helse forsøker å løse med prosjektet Helseanalyseplattformen. For å få bedre innsikt i hvilke muligheter som finnes ved å ta i bruk skyteknologi, utlyste de en konkurranse i vår, hvor ulike leverandører kunne være med å vise frem sitt forslag til løsning.
