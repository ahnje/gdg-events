The talk will have something for both beginner and advanced Android devs, namely I will show two ways to do speech recognition: the easy way (using the built-in RecognizerIntent for the user's language) and the hard way (building a recognizer which wraps existing open source libraries if the built-in RecognizerIntent can't handle the user's language). While I was in Batumi my friends and I built an app so that Kartuli users (code) (slides) could train their Androids to recognize SMS messages and web searches. Recognizing Kartuli is one of the cases where you can't use the built-in recognizer. Kartuli spoken by only 4 million people in the country of Georgia: that is roughly the population of Montreal and surrounding areas. The talk will start with a demo of our Kartuli trainer app to set the context for the talk, and then dig into the code and Android concepts under the demo.</p> <p>How to use the default system recognizer's results in your own Android projects,<br/>How to use the NDK in your projects,<br/>How to use PocketSphinx (a lightweight recognizer library written in C) on Android</p> <p><b><i>Byte-Code Weaving on Android </i></b></p> <p>by Stéphane Nicolas - Senior Android Developer for Groupon Canada</p> <p>During the last few years, we have all assisted or participated to a small revolution on Android : the emergence of annotation processing. Many popular libs now rely on annotation processing during build to pre-compute a lot of stuff that will boost them at runtime. Let's think about Dagger, ButterKnife, Hugo, RoboGuice, BoundBox, Memento, IcePick, etc.</p> <p>All those libs use annotation processing to generate data as Java source files that are executed at runtime. Nevertheless, writing annotation processors is far from obvious as they are based on the annotation processing API that is very difficult to understand.</p> <p>But there is an alternative : byte code weaving. This technique is popular in the Java World for a large variety of applications : from creating mocks (easymock/mockito) to data persistence (Eclipse Link, EBeans, etc.), or Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP).</p> <p>So, why don't we use post-compilation processing on Android too ?</p> <p>This sessions offers an overview of different byte code weaving techniques and will examine whether they can be applied to Android. We will see how post compilation byte code weaving can be used during Android apps' builds when using either Gradle or Maven.</p> <p>Finally, we will present 2 libraries : AfterBurner &amp; Mimic. They are based on javassist, and aim to make byte code manipulation easy for Android. We will go through simple use cases that will show us how to eliminate all boiler plate when using our favorite libraries and boost apps using post compilation byte code weaving. Byte code weaving could even be used to normalize new and simpler programming techniques for Android that could get standardized via Android Specification Requests.</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1411090462000,"duration":10800000,"id":"208156702","name":"GDG Montreal Android / September 2014","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1411682400000,"local_date":"2014-09-25","local_time":"18:00","updated":1412176399000,"utc_offset":-14400000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":21,"venue":{"id":16389702,"name":"Notman House","lat":45.5118408203125,"lon":-73.56986236572266,"repinned":false,"address_1":"51 Sherbrooke west","city":"Montreal","country":"ca","localized_country_name":"Canada","zip":"H2X 1X2","state":"QC"},"group":{"created":1396220081000,"name":"GDG Montreal Android","id":13635262,"join_mode":"open","lat":45.529998779296875,"lon":-73.5999984741211,"urlname":"GDG-Montreal-Android","who":"Members","localized_location":"Montréal, QC","state":"QC","country":"ca","region":"en_US","timezone":"Canada/Eastern"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Montreal-Android/events/208156702/","description":"<p><b>GDG Montreal Android / September 2014</b></p> <p><b>Overview</b></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/mag3737/514032194\">&lt;/a&gt;</p> <p>Our next meetup will be taking place Thursday September 25th, on the 3rd floor at &lt;a href=\"http://notman.org/\"&gt;Notman House</a></p> <p>Our two speakers this month are <i>Anas Ambri</i> who will introduce us to <b>Groovy on Android</b>, and <i>Simon Guerout</i> who will cover the <b>Android Account Manager</b>.</p> <p>18h00 Welcome / upcoming events 18h30 Groovy on Android 19h30 Android Account Manager 20h30~21h Wrap up</p> <p><b>Food and Drinks sponsored by PasswordBox!</b></p> <p>I'm happy to report that my employer, PasswordBox, will be sponsoring pizza and drinks for this month's Meetup.</p> <p>In turn, we want Montreal area mobile developers to know we're in full hiring mode here at PasswordBox.

But in a lot of ways, that's a bit of a dice-roll. Not everyone gets to win a Hackathon.</p> <p>The marketing students with their shiny Powerpoint deck often have very decent odds at winning vs a semi-working app with a ton of work behind it. And who's to say it's not deserved? For a 24h \"dev sprint\", Hackathons are often more about vision than hard work, even if the organizing team doesn't admit it to themselves.</p> <p>This workshop will be about preparing for Hackathons with an eye to maximizing results. We'll see how to avoid common pitfalls, work efficiently as a team, and how project templates can let you focus on your \"big idea\" <b>instead</b> of coding boilerplate all week-end long.</p> <p><b>Where?</b></p> <p><a href=\"http://d3center.ca/\">District 3</a> 1250 Guy Street, 6th Floor, Montreal</p> <p><b>When?</b></p> <p>Semptember 8th @ 18h00 EST</p> <p><b>Who?</b></p> <p>The Android Montreal GDG (Google Developer Group)</p> <p><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+EtienneCaron\">Etienne Caron</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+GinaChiodo\">Gina Chiodo</a></p> <p><b>Thanks!</b></p> <p>Many thanks to District 3 for hosting this workshop!</p> <p>Also please note, <i>places are limited</i>.

He has contributed to many interesting projects and developed a passion for optimizing application development through choosing the correct tools and approaches.</p> <p><b>About the topic:</b> Building an App is often about compromises. Rarely do we build applications on a single platform. To access over 90% of mobile users, it's necessary to build Applications for iOS AND Android. Wouldn't it be great if we could cut down on the workload? It is possible with a little bit of help! Sharing is caring.</p> <p><b><i>Make your inner designer happy with the Android Design support library </i><i>by Anas Ambri</i></b></p> <p><b>About me:</b> I work as a mobile software developer at Guarana Technologies. I enjoy working on both Android and iOS, and I am on a mission trying to convince people to stop using splash screens.</p> <p><b>About the topic: </b>Released in Google IO 2015, the Design support library is probably Android's coolest support project in the new Material Design era. It allows developers to introduce Material Design elements to apps starting from Android 2.1 (not that you should support 2.1 in the first place). In this presentation, we will try to cover some of these elements, and how you can add them to your app with minimal effort. By the end of the presentation, you won't resist the temptation of putting SnackBars all over your app, and collapsing your Toolbars with some CollapsingToolbarLayouts. And did someone say FloatingActionButton?</p> <p>And yes, because this is January, there will be a live demo.</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1456080028000,"duration":10800000,"id":"229021690","name":"February Meetup","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1456353000000,"local_date":"2016-02-24","local_time":"17:30","updated":1456418372000,"utc_offset":-18000000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":22,"venue":{"id":107341,"name":"McKibbins Irish Pub","lat":45.49721145629883,"lon":-73.57771301269531,"repinned":false,"address_1":"1426 Bishop Street","city":"Montreal","country":"ca","localized_country_name":"Canada","phone":"514 288 1580","zip":"H3G 2E6","state":"QC"},"group":{"created":1396220081000,"name":"GDG Montreal Android","id":13635262,"join_mode":"open","lat":45.529998779296875,"lon":-73.5999984741211,"urlname":"GDG-Montreal-Android","who":"Members","localized_location":"Montréal, QC","state":"QC","country":"ca","region":"en_US","timezone":"Canada/Eastern"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Montreal-Android/events/229021690/","description":"<p>____________________________________________</p> <p>GDG Android Montreal - February MeetupWednesday, February 24th 2016</p> <p><img src=\"http://www.mckibbinsirishpub.com/images/mckibbinsirishpub.png\" /></p> <p><b>McKibbin's Bishop - 1426 Bishop St., Montreal(QC), Canada</b></p> <p>• 17h30 -Socializing, Announcements</p> <p>• 18h15 - Save time : stub your APIs by Simon Guerout</p> <p>• 19h00 - Advanced Android Studio for Advanced Developers by Phillippe Breault</p> <p>• 19h45 - Networking, Socializing Socializing, </p> <p>____________________________________________</p> <p><b>Announcements</b></p> <p> You have an upcoming event, looking to hire Android developers?

This library allows you to create declarative layouts with java objects bound to the views in your xml. Rather than referencing views from the xml to update the UI, the UI will automatically respond to changes made to the bound objects. This talk will explore the power of Android Data Binding and how it is used to reduce boiler plate code.</p> <p>Bio</p> <p>Ryan Gordon has been working with Android for more than five years. His passion for Android was cultivated as a hobbyist while developing mobile applications to communicate wirelessly with micro controllers (he also has in interest in robotics). Ryan also has extensive experience with GoogleMaps as well as LibGDX with upcoming applications on the horizon. Ryan is currently working as an Android Developer with Nuglif and has made major contributions to the popular LaPresse+ and Toronto Star Touch.</p> <p><b>An Introduction to Project Tango </b><br/>by Etienne Caron</p> <p>Project Tango is a Google platform that uses computer vision to enable mobile devices, to detect their position relative to the world around them.</p> <p>This enables indoor navigation, 3D mapping, measurement of physical spaces, recognition of known environments, augmented reality, and windows into virtual 3D worlds.</p> <p>This summer, Lenovo will be releasing a sub-500$ consumer phone featuring Project Tango.

But you don't want to be dependant on App updates to enable the feature. You also want a master switch to shut it down without publishing a new App in the store, just in case. You may also want to tweak some parameters or rules on the fly, or a sandbox for internal testing. Of course you want to apply that on both iOS and Android, but somewhat be independant. Then you may want to test it with a few users first, or activate it upon some conditions. We will learn how to do that with Firebase remote-config. </p> <p>Bio</p> <p>Alan is an Android developer passionated by Mobile and the way it changes the Software industry.
