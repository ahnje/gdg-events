It's intended for people who are struggling with their first Android app. If you've gone beyond that already, you don't need this class - please drop out and let a newbie attend. There is a prerequisite of installing the SDK &amp; tools. I'm about to give the details to the organizers who will publish them. See you there! Peter van der Linden.<br/> </p> <p>PREREQUISITES. These 3 hour-long labs are intended for software developers who want to follow along with an instructor as an Android app is developed. Before attending these sessions, participants are expected to configure their development environment onto a laptop by completing the following steps:</p> <p>Download and install MOTODEV Studio for Android. Instructions on completing this step can be found at <a href=\"http://developer.motorola.com/docstools/library/Installing_MOTODEV_Studio_for_Android/\"><a href=\"http://developer.motorola.com/docstools/library/Installing_MOTODEV_Studio_for_Android/\" class=\"linkified\">http://developer.motorola.com/docstools/library/Installing_MOTODEV_Studio_for_Android/</a></a></p> <p>Make sure to install the Android SDK starter package, which is part of the above instructions and explained in greater length at <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html\"><a href=\"http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html\" class=\"linkified\">http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html</a></a>.</p> <p>Once the starter SDK is installed, add one or more Android Platform Libraries (we recommend adding Android 2.2 which is API level 8. Note: Choose a lower API level if your Android device is older than Android 2.2). This is done from within Studio through the Window&gt;Android SDK and AVD Manager option.</p> <p>Check that your installation is correct by selecting File&gt;New&gt;Android Project using Studio for Android and walking through the subsequent dialogs to create a new project.</p> <p> </p> <p>If you run into problems post at <a href=\"http://community.developer.motorola.com/t5/MOTODEV-Studio-for-Android/First-Time-Installation-Instructions-Thread/td-p/20874\"><a href=\"http://community.developer.motorola.com/t5/MOTODEV-Studio-for-Android/First-Time-Installation-Instructions-Thread/td-p/20874\" class=\"linkified\">http://community.developer.motorola.com/t5/MOTODEV-Studio-for-Android/First-Time-Installation-Instructions-Thread/td-p/20874</a></a>.</p> <p> </p> <p>Bring Android phone, USB cable, and laptop and its power suply  with the above software.

Angular is a framework which takes a very unique approach to building web-applications. Instead of providing useful api for building AJAX, apps, Angular provides a way to teach a browser new tricks which are useful for building AJAX apps. Angular is a way to shim behavior into HTML.</p> <p><b>Testacular - JavaScript Test Runner with Balls (Vojta Jína, Google)</b></p> <p>So you do TDD, right ? So we do on AngularJS. That means you run unit tests very often, and therefore you want proper tool that just works and you don't have to fight with it all the time. Testacular wants to make JS testing on real devices simple, fast and reliable. During this quick introduction we will go through a common development workflow, including automatic execution on code change or debuging directly from WebStorm IDE. <a href=\"https://github.com/vojtajina/testacular\"><a href=\"https://github.com/vojtajina/testacular\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/vojtajina/testacular</a></a></p> <p><b>Speakers' Bios:</b></p> <p><img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/b/6/2/event_103355682.jpeg\" /><b>Misko Hevery</b> works as an Agile Coach at Google where he is responsible for coaching Googlers to maintain the high level of automated testing culture.

Many people associate JavaScript with new front-end features, but it doesn’t end there. JavaScript also plays a huge part in enabling developers to build backend services quickly and easily. StackMob built its open source JavaScript SDK to provide server-side backend services for your web app. You can now create a database table in just two lines of JavaScript code. It enables people to save and fetch data to a backend or call your custom server side API in just minutes. We'll explore the implementation of StackMob’s open source library and how JavaScript technologies allow developers to integrate a robust backend into their web apps. You’ll leave the talk knowing how to build a backend service in minutes, not weeks.</p> <p><b>Smartphones in SPACE!!!</b>, Mark Micire, NASA</p> <p>Future human missions to the moon, Mars, and other destinations offer many new opportunities for exploration. Crew time will always be limited, and some work will not be feasible for astronauts to do manually. Robots can complement human explorers, performing work under remote control from a crew vehicle or even from Earth. Therefore, a central challenge is to understand how human and robot activities can be coordinated to maximize crew safety, mission success, and scientific return. This talk will discuss the use of small, free-flying, 6 degree of freedom robots on the International Space Station (ISS) to assist in such human-robot activities. Our group is using Android smart-phones to control the MIT SPHERES robots. The phones will provide the needed sensing, navigation, and planning required for remote operation from the ground. The phones were sent to ISS on the STS-135 Shuttle Mission last year, and we hope to be operating the robots by the end of the year.</p> <p>Other Background --<br/><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2011/09/01/nexus-s-takes-to-space-aboard-atlantis-does-astronauts-dirty-w/\"><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2011/09/01/nexus-s-takes-to-space-aboard-atlantis-does-astronauts-dirty-w/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.engadget.com/2011/09/01/nexus-s-takes-to-space-aboard-atlantis-does-astronauts-dirty-w/</a></a></p> <p> </p> <p><b>Presenters' BIOs:</b></p> <p><b><img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/c/c/a/event_125136042.jpeg\" /></b></p> <p><b>Sidney Maestre</b> is eating, sleeping and breathing all things mobile as StackMob's Platform Evangelist.

Two years later, in 2000, Larry and Sergey asked an intern to produce a doodle for Bastille Day which was so well received by users that a chief doodler was appointed, and doodles started showing up more and more regularly on the Google homepage.</p> <p>Over time, the demand for doodles has risen in the US and internationally. Creating doodles is now the responsibility of a team of talented illustrators (called doodlers) and engineers. For them, creating doodles has become a group effort to enliven the Google homepage and bring smiles to the faces of Google users around the world.</p> <p> </p> <p>Tonight we will meet members of the doodle team and get a behind-the-scenes look at their creative process. They will discuss how technology’s evolution has enabled them to create more beautiful and highly interactive doodles, and the challenge that brings to the technical members of the team. We will also find out about possible risks and rewards involved when one’s \"canvas\" is viewed by millions worldwide.</p> <p> </p> <p>Our moderator is devoted to Art and the Art of the Doodle. Every year the Whitney Museum honors an individual who has made a sustained commitment to the artistic and cultural heritage of the arts in America. Marissa Mayer won the award in 2011 for her work in honoring inventions and designs on Google’s homepage through its doodles. We are pleased to welcome her back to our stage to moderate tonight’s event with her team of doodlers.</p> <p>Please join us for an entertaining and inspirational evening.<br/>This event is part of our continuing Revolutionaries lecture series, featuring conversations with some of the most distinguished thinkers in the computing field.</p> <p> </p> <p>Agenda:</p> <p>6:00 PM  Member Reception</p> <p>7:00 PM  Program begins</p> <p>8:30 PM  Adjourn<br/>*** Event information as of July[masked] ends ***</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1343698291000,"id":"75625992","name":"Heads Up: Google Apps Developer Challenge 2012 ","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1345845600000,"local_date":"2012-08-24","local_time":"15:00","updated":1345856812000,"utc_offset":-25200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":29,"group":{"created":1271098240000,"name":"Google Developer Group East Bay","id":1629436,"join_mode":"open","lat":37.560001373291016,"lon":-122,"urlname":"gdgeastbay","who":"Google Developers","localized_location":"Fremont, CA","state":"CA","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Pacific"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdgeastbay/events/75625992/","description":"<p><b>Important Notice</b>: Heads Up events listed at the Google Developer Group (GDG) East Bay are selected events that some members may be interested.

Revisiting the hacker skills he learned as a kid, he started making corporate websites in 1997 to support support his theater habit. Finding the web a far more challenging and creative space than the unemployment queue, David incorporated his first company in 2000, Digital Monkey, to service the digital media needs of South Australia's arts and entertainment industry. David's second company, StarPlayit, a music learning and games technology platform, was spun out of Digital Monkey. He raised several million dollars from angel investors for StarPlayit and negotiated a term sheet for acquisition of the company for an 8 figure sum. StarPlayit lives on as an OEM licensor of music recognition algorithms. Digital Monkey was sold to an Australian based competitor. David is now the COO at Roar Engine, the complete complete, social, mobile &amp; web, cloud-based game mechanics engine.

You can write code on a Mac with <b>MonoDevelop</b>, or for Windows choose between <b>MonoDevelop</b> and <b>Visual Studio</b>. What's in it for Java developers? C# is an easy leap, and you can then re-use your code on iOS and Windows devices. We'll look at the tooling, building an Android app with C# and the principles of sharing code with iPhones, iPads and Windows.\"</p> <p> </p> <p><b>Speakers' Bio:</b></p> <p><b>Craig Dunn</b> is the Developer Evangelist for <b>Xamarin</b>. Craig's been working with MonoTouch and Mono for Android since their initial betas back in 2009, being primarily a C# developer prior to that (although with a range of experience from Smalltalk &amp; Perl to Java &amp; VBScript). Craig has previously worked on commercial iOS and Android projects using Objective-C, Java and C# before starting work at Xamarin in 2011. He currently writes code &amp; user-documentation and is working feverishly on the upcoming Evolve conference - being held in April in Austin, Texas.

Unfortunately, in the real world, there are practical problems with that approach: some features are undetectable, some tests take too long, and sometimes, its just not worth the time to do them. In this talk, I'll introduce the ideas and tools behind feature detection and then discuss where we've tried to use it at Coursera and where we failed.</p> <p><b>Beautiful Android on a Shoestring</b> (Chiu-Ki Chan)</p> <p>Want to make your app beautiful, but cannot afford a designer? Fear not, there are many easy ways to prettify your app.</p> <p>The first part of the talk covers Android techniques. Learn how to use XML and Java to touch up your app with gradients and round corners, tiling backgrounds, custom fonts and much more.</p> <p>The second part showcases various free and open source resources such as color schemes, graphics, patterns, fonts and icons. You can use them in your apps as well as web sites, flyers, posters, anywhere you need beautiful things.</p> <p>By the end of the session you will be equipped to prettify your app and make it stand out in the crowded marketplace.</p> <p> </p> <p><b>Mobile Approaches with HTML5</b> (Tomomi Imura)</p> <p>Building a mobile web no longer means dumbing down an existing desktop website. With ever-evolving HTML5 and smartphone capabilities, now you can create amazing web apps running on mobile browsers. In my talk, I will cover the adaptive and responsive design approach to support multiple form-factors from desktop to mobile phones, also the mobile-specific approach with HTML5 APIs, including device APIs that make communication between a browser and hardware possible, and enable web to have \"native\" like experiences</p> <p><b><br/>10 things you didn't know a browser could do</b> (Estelle Weyl)</p> <p>It may feel like the HTML5, CSS3 and ECMAScript specifications are moving along at a snails pace, but browser capabilities are moving quickly, and it is difficult to keep up with all the new feature support. In this session we'll cover some brand spanking new and older but unknown features that make debugging, designing and developing more fun.</p> <p><b>Automate ALL THE THINGS!</b> (Kitt Hodsden)</p> <p>From zen coding to automating commands, from code generation and browser bookmarks through webhooks to text notifications, you can make life much easier by automating parts of your web work, removing tedious, repetitive tasks and creating shortcuts so that you have more time for the interesting stuff. Let's review current techinques you need to automate all the things.</p> <p><b>NFC Tricks and Traps</b> (Christie English)</p> <p>NFC (near field communication) is a wireless technology enabling the transfer of data such as text or numbers between two NFC enabled devices such as NFC tags and NFC enabled cell phones. In this technical presentation about developing NFC applications on the Android / PhoneGap platform, we will go into the things to be aware of about NFC tags and how to support features on non-NFC and non-Android phones.</p> <p><b>Gay marriage: the database engineering perspective</b> (Liz Howard)</p> <p>Essentially, large databases with referential integrity aren't made to handle gay marriage. We'll look at some of the types of changes we'll have to make to the databases that run the country if we're going to become a progressive society. This talk looks at potential future changes to marriage, and how to establish relationships between humans in a truly nonbiased way. This humorous talk is great for beginners to database schemas and looks at how thinking ahead can save you time later, but can also lead to exploring unexpected areas of life.</p> <p><b>Best Practices for Mobile Application Development on Android</b> (Tasneem Sayeed)</p> <p>This talk will provide an overview on the best practices for developing mobile applications for the Android Platform.

And don't forget to bring the usb cable that comes with your device. If you don't want to test on an actual mobile device, that's fine also, but just make sure that Unity3D is still installed on your laptop and that your laptop comes with a webcam. </p> <p><b>Optional</b></p> <p>If you'd like to further prepare for this workshop, you can do so by registering with <a href=\"http://developer.vuforia.com/\">Vuforia</a>, confirming your email address, and creating a <a href=\"https://developer.vuforia.com/targetmanager/licenseManager/licenseListing\">free license key</a>. When creating the license key, just pick Android, iOS, or digital eyeware depending on what device you bring with you (and if you have your own digital 3D AR glasses, bring them with you, it would be great to test the same application on it, and it would also be great to see how your glasses compare to the Moverio BT-200).</p> <p>When downloading the Vuforia SDK, download the <a href=\"https://developer.vuforia.com/downloads/sdk\">\"Unity Vuforia SDK\"</a> (which is cross-platform on Android and iOS). This SDK is only 33.16 MB.  Double-clicking on it should bring up automatically Unity (assuming Unity3D is installed correctly). We won't be covering the native Android or iOS Vuforia SDKs, so there is no need to download those. There won't be any need to bring your own paper markers (unless you create your own <a href=\"https://developer.vuforia.com/targetmanager/project/checkDeviceProjectsCreated?dataRequestedForUserId=\">custom</a> one). I'll bring many paper copies of the <a href=\"https://howtofoldandotherstuff.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/stones.jpg\">Stones</a> marker, which Vuforia uses by default for many of its samples. </p> <p>If you want to select your own free 3D animation before I select one for you during the workshop, you can select one by going to the Unity <a href=\"https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/\">asset store</a> and using its filter to filter for free assets (click on the little triangle next to filter a second time if it only gives you access to sorting). You can also get to the asset store directly from Unity by pressing Ctrl-9 (or Cmd-9 on a Mac).</p> <p><b>Bio: </b></p> <p><b>Stephan Branczyk</b></p> <p>Android mobile programming expert and Developer Evangelist for Epson-Moverio AR glasses.

We've taken the quick, dynamic workflow that JavaScript provides, and coupled it with an advanced, native UI framework designed specifically for building beautiful mobile apps. All of this helps us to reduce iteration time between changes to an absolute minimum without sacrificing native performance, making app development faster, easier, and a heck of a lot more fun.</p> <p>In this introductory workshop, we'll give a quick overview of the technology and demo exciting possibilities Fuse opens for our users such as instant, on-device update of code and markup, and specialized user interface primitives designed tosuccinctly describe data presentation and animation in a way you only dreamed of with HTML5. All along the way, we'll get live, hands-on experience working with these tools, on our devices, fully native, in real-time.</p> <p>Presenters:</p> <p>Three Fuse engineers from Norway<br/>Andreas Kennedy Rønning<br/>Kristian Hasselknippe<br/>Morten Fornes (CTO)</p> <p>Download:</p> <p>fusetools.com</p> <p>Fuse communications:</p> <p>Twitter: @fusetoolsFB: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/fusetools/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.facebook.com/fusetools/</a></p> <p>Slack community:</p> <p><a href=\"https://slackcommunity.fusetools.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://slackcommunity.fusetools.com/</a></p> <p>Video Tutorials:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdlqWm6b-XALJgM3fGa4q95Yipsgb8Q1o\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdlqWm6b-XALJgM3fGa4q95Yipsgb8Q1o</a></p> <p>Speaker will be announced very soon</p> <p>Agenda:<br/>7:00pm Networking + Food &amp; Drink sponsored by Hurricane Electric<br/>8:00pm Presentation<br/>8:45pm Q&amp;A<br/>9:00pm End</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1466107473000,"id":"231946798","name":"TensorFlow Hands-on workshop","rsvp_limit":10,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1476565200000,"local_date":"2016-10-15","local_time":"14:00","updated":1476796436000,"utc_offset":-25200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":10,"venue":{"id":24584100,"name":"Peet's Coffee","lat":37.778465270996094,"lon":-122.2768325805664,"repinned":false,"address_1":"1901 Webster St","city":"Alameda","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"","state":"CA"},"group":{"created":1271098240000,"name":"Google Developer Group East Bay","id":1629436,"join_mode":"open","lat":37.560001373291016,"lon":-122,"urlname":"gdgeastbay","who":"Google Developers","localized_location":"Fremont, CA","state":"CA","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Pacific"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdgeastbay/events/231946798/","description":"<p>Please note that the meeting has been postponed to October 8 so that more people can attend.</p> <p>////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////</p> <p>This is a Hands-on workshop for installation and running of TensorFlow.</p> <p>Please download necessary components before hand.
