For those in the industry the answer was easy, the Laserdisc was far superior over the VHS tapes. Looking back on history however, it is clear that the VHS served customers so much better simply because it fitted what people needed at the time.</p> <p>Today, at the dawn of a ubiquitous world, we can see a similar rivalry in the field of connected devices. Both collectives and organisations are trying to figure out how they can get a piece of the pie. Should it be a custom proprietary communications platform, a custom cloud solution? Or should it be an open source alternative that one could adopt and contribute too?</p> <p>The Weave protocol is a solution following the latter form. Originated in the NEST labs and now adopted by Google, Weave, on top of Brillo or stand alone, is a completely open communications protocol that one can use to connect devices in a smart and handy way. Because of choices such as XMPP and mDNS, which clearly point out well thought through User Experience Design, Google offers a full end-to-end answer to this question. Because of these clever decisions it also opens the door for new business models for individuals, collectives and enterprises.</p> <p>In this talk I want to share my thoughts on why I think that Weave might be the solution to this major question everybody in the business of ubiquitous faces. I want to show how it works, why it works and how Google seems to follow their own model of supporting a platform so well, that people want to sign up for their free cloud based solution and share their data without introducing any proprietary obstacles.</p> <p><b>Setup</b></p> <p>During this event we will have:</p> <p>• Introduction on Brillo and WeaveLightning talks</p> <p>• Join us for our session at a special location: Skylounge Amsterdam!</p> <p><b>Speakers &amp; Agenda</b></p> <p>17:30: Doors open</p> <p>18:00: Introduction to Brillo and Weave</p> <p>19:00: Break</p> <p>19:15: Lighting Talks/Feel free to share your experiences</p> <p>20:00: wrap-up, socialize</p> <p><b>Prerequisite</b></p> <p>Whether you are using GCP/Brillo/Weave, or aren’t using familiar with GCP/Brillo/Weave: we encourage every development enthusiast to join and make this event memorable!</p> <p><b>Location</b></p> <p>Skylounge Amsterdam, Doubletree by Hilton: Oosterdoksstraat 4, 1011 DK, AmsterdamNote: Since it's in the city center it is advised to take public transportation, see <a href=\"http://www.skyloungeamsterdam.com/en/\">here for more information on the location</a></p> <p><b>Foody stuff</b></p> <p>Recommend you grab a bite to eat on the way, we'll have snacks and beer but not a full dinner.</p> <p>Hope to hear and see you at this event.

He will share his vision on GCP and ANP. After studying (Bachelor of ICT) Mark was a partner in 1996 in an IT startup that quickly developed into a content hub for publishers who thus could sell and distribute their content in the B2B market. This company was acquired in 2004 by the ANP. Mark is currently CTO and Operations Manager at the ANP. </p> <p>We also have another GCP Customer, Jordy Cuiper from Fanly who will share his story too. Jord Cuiper is a 27 year old entrepreneur and founder of Fanly. Fanly is a cloud-based loyalty platform for (SME+) retailers which enables them to build strong customer relationships and increase revenues. Fanly looks back on a very successful first year ('15) with over 350 participating retailers, 900% growth in sales, many successcases and a strong &amp; fun team. Jord’s ambition is to grow Fanly (and the team) to one of the leading players in offering cloud based loyalty solutions (Saas) to medium-sized retailers, POS providers and other retail related third parties in Europe. And.. have lots of fun along the way. Most important to Jord is to be in control of his own path, failures and successes. In addition to that his family, friends and the people he works with on a day to day basis mean the world to him. He considers himself a very lucky guy because of the fact that these people are the most inspiring, talented and fun people!

The advantage of going with public transport is the free Watertaxi ride at the end of the event. (More info below)</p> <p>By car : This one's easy. There is plenty of free parking space nearby, from the highway follow the signs Heijplaat / RDM</p> <p>By public transport : From Rotterdam Centraal, it's easiest to rent an OV fiets and ride to Jobshaven, where there is a Waterbus leaving. Taking the tram to the Waterbus is also possible, but you'd likely miss the connection. The Waterbus only leaves every 30 min. You can take your bike on the Waterbus, but if you plan on taking the Watertaxi back with us, please leave your bike at Jobshaven as you are not allowed to take it with you on the Watertaxi!</p> <p>Return trip : The last Waterbus back to Jobshaven departs at 20:20. So we have arranged (free!) Watertaxi's leaving at around the end of the event. Watertaxi's are really fast and very cool, so I can definitely recommend it!</p> <p>Once you're at RDM, please follow these directions to get into the building:</p> <p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=14M-xcPwYqZtb0CzUE2Hp9LKZN5e-CL15\" class=\"linkified\">https://drive.google.com/open?id=14M-xcPwYqZtb0CzUE2Hp9LKZN5e-CL15</a></p> <p>I will make sure to have you guided from there!</p> <p>Captain AI and <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/RDMTech/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/RDMTech/</a> are sponsoring location, drinks and food.</p> <p>• GeoAI: Automatic Detection of Zebra Crossings in Aerial Imagery by Maartje Holtslag &amp; Niels van der Vaart (Esri Nederland)</p> <p>Zebra crossings are an important feature on Dutch streets, as they give pedestrians the opportunity to safely cross roads. However, in the Netherlands the exact locations of zebra crossings are not known. In this project I created a method to automatically detect zebra crossings in aerial imagery, by using the TensorFlow Object Detection API to create a neural network model. The Scikit-Optimize library was used to optimize the hyper-parameters of this model. The final model was implemented into ArcGIS Pro to be able to detect zebra crossings in aerial imagery in a live environment.</p> <p>Machine learning can be applied in many different fields. One of the relatively new fields in which machine learning is currently explored is the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) field. Spatial data cannot only be used to visualize results, but interesting analysis can be performed using this information. During this presentation an overview will be given of the possibilities when combining machine learning with GIS. A demonstration will show how an object detection framework is used to detect zebra crossings in aerial imagery.</p> <p>• Deep Reinforcement Learning with Unity 3D by Gerard Simons (Captain AI)</p> <p>Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a very exciting relatively new field of machine learning, that has gained much notoriety thanks to the recent achievements of Deep Mind's Alpha Go. The idea behind it is to train a deep neural network to exhibit desirable behaviour by interacting with an environment. More specifically, it learns a series of actions, called a policy, that maximises a user-defined reward function given the current state of environment. Unity 3D is a popular game engine that has recently incorporated a new open-source plug-in called ML Agents that allows anyone to develop these RL agents inside a Unity game.</p> <p>At Captain AI we have experimented with this plug-in to show the potential of RL for solving navigational tasks in a maritime environment. During the presentation we will discuss the theory and principles behind RL, how Unity 3D and the MLAgents plugin works and show you what all this looks like in an autonomous shipping scenario.</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1531400593000,"duration":14400000,"id":"252703831","name":"Google Cloud Next - Extended","rsvp_limit":80,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1532446200000,"local_date":"2018-07-24","local_time":"17:30","updated":1532477056000,"utc_offset":7200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":80,"venue":{"id":24900565,"name":"Google Amsterdam","lat":52.3377685546875,"lon":4.872392177581787,"repinned":false,"address_1":"Claude Debussylaan 34 (15th Floor)","city":"Amsterdam","country":"nl","localized_country_name":"Netherlands"},"group":{"created":1449501979000,"name":"GDG Cloud Netherlands","id":19190507,"join_mode":"open","lat":52.369998931884766,"lon":4.889999866485596,"urlname":"gdgcloudnl","who":"Members","localized_location":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","state":"","country":"nl","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Amsterdam"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdgcloudnl/events/252703831/","description":"<p>Before we get our Google Cloud NEXT in Amsterdam, the largest gathering of the GCP community starts of its tour in San Francisco with big announcements!
