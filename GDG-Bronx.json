Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated between them. The flexible architecture allows you to deploy computation to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device with a single API.

It\u2019s about making products that people find useful and usable. This is as much the case for the new age of voice-first products as it is for products with more traditional interfaces. In this talk, we\u2019ll discuss what Conversation Design is, and the steps you can easily take to optimize the conversations your customers have with your products.</p> <p>Allen Firstenberg: Take Action! Building for the Google Assistant</p> <p>Now that you know what a good conversation sounds like, Allen will discuss how to turn this into a great Action. Using tools such as Dialogflow and the Actions on Google library, you'll learn what you need to know to start developing your first Action for the Google Assistant.
