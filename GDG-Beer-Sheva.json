So, can we do better?</p> <p>In this meetup, we will introduce the leading cross-platform solutions in the market:<br/>* Flutter by Google<br/>* React-Native by Facebook.</p> <p>We will understand why companies such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Wix, and many others invest in cross-platform technologies.<br/>Following that, we will cover the architecture of these frameworks, the benefits and of course the challenges.</p> <p>If you are an Android/iOS developer, a web developer, or any developer that wants to get familiar with cross-platform development, this meetup is for you!</p> <p>// Schedule:<br/>18:00 - 18:30 - Gathering, drinks and food<br/>18:30 - 19:15 - Introduction to React Native / Lev Vidrak<br/>19:15 - 19:25 - break<br/>19:25 - 20:10 - Introduction to Flutter / Moti Bar-Tov</p> <p>// Introduction to React Native</p> <p>React Native is Facebooks’s cross-platform framework, allowing developers to compose apps using JavaScript in a declarative way.</p> <p>At Wix.com we are building our mobile app with React Native from the first commit almost three years ago. Scaling a production-grade application, brought us to understand the real cost-benefit of React Native.</p> <p>In this talk, we'll start by reviewing React Native's main concepts and understand it's architecture. Continue by covering its great benefits, the challenges we overcome, and those we are still facing.</p> <p>// Introduction to Flutter</p> <p>Flutter is Google's new framework for developing beautiful mobile apps based on a single codebase, written in Dart programming language, for both Android and IOS and in the future, for more platforms.</p> <p>Flutter 1.0 released on December 2018 and its popularity is growing highly these days as there are already thousands of released apps and many companies around the world, are seriously considering it as an option for their new products.</p> <p>In this meetup, we will take a first look at this framework, learn how we can get started with it, see some apps, discuss its basics concepts such as Widget, Context and State, and answer relevant questions.</p> <p>// Bio</p> <p>* Lev Vidrak, mobile developer @ Wix -<br/>For the past 10 years, I work as a software engineer, focusing mostly on mobile development.

As an Android developer I am highly experienced with Java and Kotlin and all of Android api's and libraries such as RxJava, MVP and MVVM architectures. Flutter is my new passion and so far, I've developed my first Flutter app for Tikal, and made a few Flutter lectures at the Droidcon Tel Aviv 2018 event, and at Tikal's Flutter Meetup, and a Flutter workshop in Tikal's Fullstack Techradar event.</p> <p>This event is brought to you by WIX <a href=\"http://wix.engineering\" class=\"linkified\">http://wix.engineering</a></p> <p>RSVP here :<br/><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/at-wix/events/261038409/?fbclid=IwAR1frAwg7tKeQJFG4V5UC_HvZQ0XA_Y01DYudyeGRvDnpxMHDbjepyj-0_I\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/at-wix/events/261038409/?fbclid=IwAR1frAwg7tKeQJFG4V5UC_HvZQ0XA_Y01DYudyeGRvDnpxMHDbjepyj-0_I</a></p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1564310653000,"duration":7200000,"id":"263525481","name":"GOOGLE PLAY INSTANT - APPS","rsvp_limit":50,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1565794800000,"local_date":"2019-08-14","local_time":"18:00","updated":1565804701000,"utc_offset":10800000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":10,"venue":{"id":20659452,"name":"Incubit","lat":0,"lon":0,"repinned":false,"address_1":"HaEnergia 77","city":"Be'er Sheva","country":"il","localized_country_name":"Israel"},"group":{"created":1339659809000,"name":"GDG Beer Sheva","id":4079132,"join_mode":"open","lat":31.25,"lon":34.79999923706055,"urlname":"GDG-Beer-Sheva","who":"GDGers","localized_location":"Be'er Sheva, Israel","state":"","country":"il","region":"en_US","timezone":"Asia/Jerusalem"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Beer-Sheva/events/263525481/","description":"<p>Native Android apps, without the installation<br/>With Google Play Instant, people can tap to try an app or game without installing it first.
