Megs Carter will be speaking on Strong, Kind, and Broken in All the Best Ways:<br/>Using agile methods to take your life back.</p> <p>**<br/>Depression and anxiety have been a part of my life for nearly 2 decades, and with it came feelings of shame and self-condemnation. However, in my day-to-day existence of working with agile teams, I love their imperfections and remind my teams daily that they do not have to be perfect. If I can treat my agile delivery teams with compassion and understanding, why couldn’t I extend that to myself? Agile delivery isn’t just an IT process. It’s a way of bringing people together to tackle challenges and create change. By applying agile methods to myself, I’ve been able to improve my quality of life and focus on the areas that are most valuable to me. If you are someone interested in making a change in your life, this talk will hopefully inspire you.<br/>**</p> <p>Megs has worked with agile delivery teams for 5 years and believes that treating folks with compassion and respect is the key to kickass teams of ninja problem solvers. Always searching for practical solutions, she doesn’t buy into capital-A agile dogma. Instead she likes meet people where they are in order to solve real problems and create valuable change. Away from the office, she sings to her cats and does her best to embarrass her teenage daughter and husband in St Louis, MO.</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1531859631000,"duration":10800000,"id":"252879817","name":"Flutter Study Jam","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1541462400000,"local_date":"2018-11-05","local_time":"18:00","updated":1549083693000,"utc_offset":-21600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":25,"venue":{"id":25643320,"name":"Slalom","lat":38.64979553222656,"lon":-90.33724975585938,"repinned":true,"address_1":"7800 Forsyth Blvd Suite 850","city":"Saint Louis","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"","state":"MO"},"group":{"created":1445567096000,"name":"GDG St Louis: Google Developers Group St Louis","id":19052755,"join_mode":"open","lat":38.70000076293945,"lon":-90.45999908447266,"urlname":"GDGSTL","who":"Googlers","localized_location":"Saint Louis, MO","state":"MO","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Central"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDGSTL/events/252879817/","manual_attendance_count":40,"description":"<p>Come learn flutter with us with Erik Wolfe!
