This is a noticeable barrier to new users to adopt machine learning to solve their problems.</p> <p>Automatic machine learning (AutoML) is an emerging field of machine learning that targets to help users adopt machine learning with the optimal design decision and parameter configuration in an automatic way. With AutoML, the users just need to provide input data and problem specification, AutoML determines the optimal approach, model architecture, and hyperparameters for the best performance.</p> <p>This talk addresses the changing world of automatic machine learning, from state of research to practical applications. The talk will cover three major issues. First, the talk starts from a review of the state of the art in automatic machine learning research, specifically in HyperParameter Optimization(HPO), Neural architect search (NAS), and Meta Learning. Second, it reviews open-source developments for AutoML. Finally, it provides practical examples of using AutoML.</p> <p>Schedule:<br/>6:30-7:00: Networking, snacks, and refreshments<br/>7:00-7:45: Automatic Machine Learning (AutoML)<br/>7:45-8:00: Q&amp;A<br/>8:00-8:30: Networking</p> <p>About our speaker:</p> <p>Hieu Dang currently works as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at SkipTheDishes Inc.

He obtained his PhD in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Manitoba, Winnipeg in 2015. His research interests include deep learning, probabilistic graphical models, nonlinear optimization, stochastic processes, and signal and image processing.
