Bring plenty of questions and have your own projects handy in case you'd like us to analyze them to better understand your current site performance and its placement for various search terms. Topics include:<br/>- AMP (accelerated mobile page): What it is, how to use it, and why you might want to.<br/>- Exploring Google's philosophy of search ranking and where to best focus your efforts to achieve higher placements.<br/>- PWAs (progressive web applications): A modern scaffold for creating websites that integrate with phones and tablets (and AMP!).<br/>- Networking opportunities follow the presentation and Q&amp;A. Let's meet each other to determine future topics and speakers!</p> ","how_to_find_us":"Brick building facing 2nd Ave with paid parking in the back and street parking on the side roads.

This presentation will give you the tools to start building basic apps right away. While some experience in programming would be useful, it isn\u2019t required. To actively participate and get the most out of the presentation, you will want to bring a laptop with Android Studio preloaded (link at bottom).</p> <p>This presentation will be structured as a guided code lab. After a quick introduction we\u2019ll start building a basic app with a holiday theme. Specific topics will include:<br/>-Using the designer that is built into Android Studio for creating user interfaces. We\u2019ll touch on ConstraintLayout, TextViews, and buttons.<br/>-Connecting the user interface to Java code.<br/>-Switching between screens (Activities).<br/>-A Q&amp;A will follow the presentation.</p> <p>Android Studio Link: <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/studio/\" class=\"linkified\">https://developer.android.com/studio/</a></p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1548957788000,"duration":7200000,"id":"258565021","name":"Using Firebase to Make Data Driven Decisions","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1551146400000,"local_date":"2019-02-25","local_time":"18:00","updated":1551159049000,"utc_offset":-28800000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":6,"venue":{"id":24128282,"name":"Startup Spokane Central","lat":47.65455627441406,"lon":-117.42143249511719,"repinned":false,"address_1":"610 W 2nd Ave","city":"Spokane","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"","state":"WA"},"group":{"created":1531497814000,"name":"GDG Spokane","id":29233861,"join_mode":"open","lat":47.66999816894531,"lon":-117.43000030517578,"urlname":"GDG-Spokane","who":"Members","localized_location":"Spokane, WA","state":"WA","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Pacific"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Spokane/events/258565021/","description":"<p>DOOR PRIZES!

Firebase allows you to remotely turn on/off a feature without rolling an app update. You can also A/B test your feature to learn about its impact on important metrics such as user engagement and retention. These are just a few of the features of Firebase that will be discussed in the next GDG Spokane meetup.</p> <p>The second half of the presentation will be a guided code lab.
