This is a chance to get a professional accreditation that demonstrates you have an understanding of basic and advanced aspects of mobile website design and development. By learning together we think it’s going to be more fun and more of us are going to be able to complete it.</p> <p>Requirements<br/>You need basic web development skills to take part and it typically it takes 3-4 hours to run through the course materials, followed by a 90 minute multiple choice exam. You can find more details on the course here. It’s possible to do it entirely online alone, but we’d like to run through it together as a group.</p> <p>Why do it?<br/>There is more traffic to mobile sites than desktop yet most sites don’t provide an effective experience for users. Best practice is changing rapidly so what people may have learned a few years ago may not be up to date. For companies and site owners we see better mobile design leading to significant and measurable improvements in customer acquisition, retention and engagement.</p> <p>Sounds great, where do I sign up?<br/>Just let us know and place your RSVP here.</p> <p>Background info<br/>The Mobile Sites Certification is part of the Google certification catalog. See here for more details about the certification and the topics we are going to cover during the Study Jam.</p> <p><a href=\"https://academy.exceedlms.com/student/path/2967\" class=\"linkified\">https://academy.exceedlms.com/student/path/2967</a></p> <p>Networking<br/>As usual there will be opportunities to exchange with other IT geeks and girlz!</p> <p>• What to bring<br/>Bring your laptop and something to take notes.</p> <p>• Important to know</p> ","how_to_find_us":"Cassis - IBL Business Park","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1517932899000,"duration":7200000,"id":"247545697","name":"Create your first machine learning program using TensorFlow","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1519452000000,"local_date":"2018-02-24","local_time":"10:00","updated":1519627684000,"utc_offset":14400000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":22,"venue":{"id":25409341,"name":"African Leadership College (ALC)","lat":-20.097843170166016,"lon":57.57327651977539,"repinned":false,"address_1":"Beau Plan Business Park","city":"Pamplemousses","country":"mu","localized_country_name":"Mauritius"},"group":{"created":1506334329000,"name":"GDG Mauritius","id":26046031,"join_mode":"open","lat":-20.270000457763672,"lon":57.369998931884766,"urlname":"GDG-Mauritius","who":"Members","localized_location":"Flic en Flac, Mauritius","state":"","country":"mu","region":"en_US","timezone":"Indian/Mauritius"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Mauritius/events/247545697/","manual_attendance_count":10,"description":"<p>• What we'll do<br/>The meeting will start with a general introduction to Artificial Intelligence.
