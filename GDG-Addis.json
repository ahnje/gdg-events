As a pioneer in the industry, Google now offers Android and Unity developers a reach of over 100 million ARCore-compatible devices through its ARCore platform.</p> <p>ARCore is Google’s platform for building augmented reality experiences. Using different APIs, ARCore enables your phone to sense its environment, understand the world and interact with information. Some of the APIs are available across Android and iOS to enable shared AR experiences.</p> <p>ARCore provides SDKs for many of the most popular development environments. These SDKs provide native APIs for all of the essential AR features like motion tracking, environmental understanding, and light estimation. With these capabilities you can build entirely new AR experiences or enhance existing apps with AR features.</p> <p>Curious about what ARCore can do and how to develop for it? Come to this workshop and learn how to get started! We’ll cover how ARCore works and what you need to get started using either Unity or Android Studio. After, we’ll work through some codelabs (guided step-by-step tutorials).</p> <p>This workshop best suited for Android and/or Unity developers who are keen to introduce Augmented Reality elements to their existing mobile projects. It will be hosted on Saturday Jan 5th, 2019 from 9AM to 5PM ( Local ከጠዋቱ 3 ሰአት እስከ ማታ 11 ሰአት) at American Center inside Wemezekir compound, behind National Bank, Addis Ababa Ethiopia.</p> <p>PS =&gt; you need to install JDK 8, Android Studio and/or Unity[masked] LTS or later and ARCore SDK for Unity (recommended version: v1.5.0) on your machine before coming to the workshop. Make sure you setup your environment as stated here:<br/>1. For Android: <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/java/quickstart\" class=\"linkified\">https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/java/quickstart</a><br/>2.
