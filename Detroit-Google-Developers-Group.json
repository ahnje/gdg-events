Each speaker will get 15-20 minutes to present and at the end of the evening we will have a question and answer period.</p> <p>The order of the presentations will be:</p> <p><b>Lightning Talk No. 1</b></p> <p>Mat Stollman will present on Behavior Driven Development (BDD) and testing Mobile Applications using the BDD style. In particular he will cover UI testing of mobile applications. There are many tools out there currently to UI test mobile applications and Mat has experimented with many of them. He will cover how he recently started using a testing tool called Cucumber to run automated acceptance tests on Android and iOS devices.</p> <p><i>About Mat Stollman</i></p> <p>Mat Stollman is a mobile software quality assurance analyst for Quicken Loans. He helps build Quicken Loans mobile testing infrostructure using and testing it out with various open source frameworks. He also likes cats.</p> <p><b>Lightning Talk No. 2</b></p> <p><i>Build a Gateway with Google OpenID APIs</i></p> <p>Google offers many services and some of these (like Google Apps) are federated; that is, a user can use a non-Google account to log into Google Apps. On the flip side, can a Google account be used to log into non-Google services? The answer is yes, since Google is an OpenID identity provider.</p> <p>This lightning talk describes how to federate Google identities with non-Google services. In particular, we will demo a prototype that gateways Google identity (based on OpenID 2.0) into the InCommon Federation (a SAML federation of higher ed institutions).</p> <p><i>About Tom Scavo</i></p> <p>Tom is a long-time developer, teacher, and general technologist (you know the type). An enterprise SAML technologist by trade, Tom is finally coming to appreciate the utility of lightweight APIs and the security technologies springing up around them.</p> <p>Tom lives and works in Ann Arbor, Michigan. He is Operations Manager for the InCommon Federation (<a href=\"http://www.incommon.org/\">incommon.org</a>), a trust federation of higher education institutions in the US. He loves to write, cycle, and enjoys films of all kinds.</p> <p><b>Lightning Talk No. 3</b></p> <p><i>Accessing Google API's with OAuth 2.0</i> Google has a wealth of information hidden behind its API's. Much of it requires user authentication, OAuth 2.0 is Google's preferred mechanism for authenticating users. This talk will focus on what OAuth 2 is, how it works, registering an app on the Google API console, Google's libraries for performing OAuth 2 authentication,  and some examples of working with Google API's. <i>About Dave Turner</i> Dave Turner loves to code, and has been doing it in some form since 1999. He is experienced in many areas of software design and development including;  database, web, desktop, automation processing and mobile devices.</p> <p><b>MORE DETAILS:</b></p> <p><i>THE HOW:</i> We will be meeting at the Quicken Loans Chase Building Security Desk and will go up to the meeting room from there.

It offers features not found in the official Android based firmwares of vendors of these cell phones.</p> <p>In short, CyanogenMod is a custom version of Android that users can load onto their Android phones. It provides all kinds of goodies not found in the stock Android operating system that ships with many phones. For Android phones that are heavily themed by their manufacturers (ie Samsung, HTC, Motorola), CyanogenMod provides a very clean stock Android experience with some extra features. CyanogenMod is one the best known and most widely used custom Android experiences out there.

Overall, this event will cater to those who want to attend sessions and learn as well as to those who may want to gain some hands-on coding experience. All of the exercises and tutorials will be optional for those attendees who wish to participate. Attendees are encouraged to bring their development machines to hack on code as they wish.</p> <p>The DevFest will officially start with introductions at 9:00am. Attendees who may have not coded in Android in a bit, or who wish to ensure their machines are ready for the DevFest sessions, will be able to arrive early, from 8:00am to 9:00am to work with volunteers to ensure their machines are up to snuff and ready for the day. Sessions will officially end around 5:00pm.

The presentations are detailed below.</i></p> <p><b>Testing - The Final Frontier in Android by Mat Stollman</b></p> <p>BEHOLD! Testing! The final frontier of Android Application development. These are the voyages of the GDG. We will talk about what it takes to successfully test out your Android app to the point of perfection. Testing by means of Functional testing, Regression testing and Automation. We will dive into several automation frameworks to compliment your  development and testing methods. If you are lucky, we may even talk about the illusive unit testing (gasp). There may not be beer, but there will be a new found confidence in your apps! </p> <p><i>Mat Stollman</i> is a Quality Assurance Analyst at Quicken Loans who works primarily on mobile apps. He is also likes cats.</p> <p><b>Building with Gradle - Not you Parent's Build Script by Don Ward</b></p> <p>With the introduction of Android Studio at Google I/O in May of this year, a new build system for Android using Gradle was introduced. Slowly fading from the landscape is the time honoured favourite Ant script. Gradle in many ways is more flexible, easier to develop with and more accessible to the Android developer. In Android Studio, Gradle is front and centre, and hooks have been added in Eclipse to switch to Gradle also. </p> <p>In this talk, we will discuss the background of Gradle, how Android leverages Gradle for it's own uses and some of the advantages of Gradle over Ant. There may not be dancing ladies, but you will be empowered to hack your build script with new found freedom.  </p> <p><i>Don Ward </i>is an Android developer at Quicken Loans in Detroit. He is an avid Google Tech fan and co-leader of the Detroit GDG.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE:</b> Food and beverages will be provided for this meeting.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE</b>: Unfortunately, we can not validate parking for this event.

Now that 90% of Android consumer devices and 100% of Android Things devices run software that supports BLE, there’s never been a better time for Android developers to jump into the rapidly-growing IoT ecosystem and start building their own companion apps or custom smart devices. </p> <p>Unfortunately, Android’s Bluetooth stack has a well-deserved reputation for being difficult to work with. The documentation is patchy, the API abstractions are leaky, and the stack itself is unreliable. Stuart has worked through all these challenges while building a pro audio app at the start of 2017, and now is sharing his story to save you time. </p> <p>The beginning of this talk will cover BLE basics. The remainder will showcase code samples and strategies for tackling the quirks of the Android Bluetooth stack. No prior experience with BLE is required to enjoy this talk. You’ll leave excited to tinker with BLE on Android and equipped with a roadmap and toolkit to help you navigate the nasty parts. </p> <p><b>About Stuart Kent</b></p> <p>Stuart is software developer with 3.5 years' mobile experience. He currently work at Detroit Labs creating native Android and iOS apps for national and international brands in the utilities, QSR, automotive, and pro audio industries.

Google provides each attendee access to QwikLabs (online course training) during the Study Jam to work through and learn about cloud computing as well as Google Cloud offerings. A Study Jam session differs from our typical monthly presentations that the Detroit Google Developers Group hosts. Study jams are self-paced sessions where a bunch of developers meet and work through some exercises and courses.</p> <p>What will you learn?<br/>Specifically you will learn the fundamentals of the Google Cloud Platform, how to run containers on it and how to use the platform for data engineering. You will get free access to the labs ($70+ value). No need to create a Google Cloud Platform account or register with a credit card. More details below:<br/>• You will learn how to some of the Google Cloud offerings in a self-paced course.<br/>• Learn how to set up development and production environments in the Cloud.<br/>• Learn how Docker and Kubernetes work, or learn how to process Big Data in the Cloud.<br/>• Get access to Qwiklabs.com, a Google training tool, free of charge (a $70+ value).<br/>• Get Google-hosted badges like this for their online profiles, to show potential employers what they know about Cloud computing.</p> <p>*****PLEASE NOTE: Please bring your own laptop computer.
