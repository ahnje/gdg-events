With a large database of photos, companies run the risk of running afoul of regulations which can cost many millions in fines.<br/>During this session, we will demonstrate how we use Machine Learning to solve this problem at different levels through facial recognition models and categorization of unstructured data, e.g. DNS entries.<br/>As data privacy becomes a larger issue in Singapore, some of the techniques can be reused to ensure that data breaches can be detected and not compromised.</p> <p>[Talk 2]<br/>Topic: Using BigQuery for Large Data Processing</p> <p>Speaker: Nito Buendia, Customer Solution Engineer Google<br/>Bio: Nito is a Customer Solutions Engineer at Google; working on building scalable automation and data solutions for Google's largest advertisers. During his tenure at Google, he has mainly focused on Automation and delivering solutions for teams to operate at 10x scale. He is passionate about empowering businesses through digitization and technology.</p> <p>Sypnosis: BigQuery is Google Cloud's highly scalable, enterprise-ready data warehouse; which will allow you to focus on analyzing large data sets without worrying about the infrastructure. On this session, we will learn what BigQuery is and the benefits that can bring to your business and data projects. We will also explore some enterprise architecture examples and showcase how you can optimize and improve the performance of analyses.</p> <p>[Talk 3]<br/>Topic: Responsible AI Practices: Fairness in ML</p> <p>Speaker:<br/>Bio: Andrew Zaldivar is a Developer Advocate for Google AI. His job is to help to bring the benefits of AI to everyone. Andrew develops, evaluates, and promotes tools and techniques that can help communities build responsible AI systems, writing posts for the Google Developers blog and speaking at a variety of conferences. Before joining Google AI, Andrew was a Senior Strategist in Google’s Trust &amp; Safety group and worked on protecting the integrity of some of Google’s key products by using machine learning to scale, optimize and automate abuse-fighting efforts. Prior to joining Google, Andrew completed his Ph.D. in Cognitive Neuroscience from the University of California, Irvine and was an Insight Data Science fellow.</p> <p>Sypnosis: AI systems are enabling new experiences and abilities for people around the globe. The risk is that any unfairness in such systems can also have a wide-scale impact. Thus, as the impact of AI increases across sectors and societies, it is critical to work towards systems that are fair and inclusive for all. This talk will share some of our current work and recommended practices for building fairer and more inclusive AI systems.</p> <p>[Additional Information]<br/>For a more organized QnA session, we would be using this tool provided by this website:<br/><a href=\"https://www.sli.do/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.sli.do/</a><br/>Go to the website and type the code: GCPUGSG</p> ","how_to_find_us":"Head to level 3 at the guest entrance","visibility":"public"},{"created":1547573082000,"duration":7200000,"id":"258099884","name":"Delivering software; Hopefully without bugs","rsvp_limit":350,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1552473000000,"local_date":"2019-03-13","local_time":"18:30","updated":1552483492000,"utc_offset":28800000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":332,"venue":{"id":25033205,"name":"Google Asia Pacific","lat":1.2764660120010376,"lon":103.79895782470703,"repinned":true,"address_1":"70, Pasir Panjang Road, #03-71, Mapletree Business City, Singapore 117371","city":"Singapore","country":"sg","localized_country_name":"Singapore"},"group":{"created":1466218567000,"name":"Google Cloud Platform User Group Singapore","id":20085788,"join_mode":"open","lat":1.2999999523162842,"lon":103.8499984741211,"urlname":"GCPUGSG","who":"Members","localized_location":"Singapore, Singapore","state":"","country":"sg","region":"en_US","timezone":"Asia/Singapore"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GCPUGSG/events/258099884/","description":"<p>There are 3 talks for this session!!</p> <p>We would probably start the talk promptly at 7pm as there 3 pretty meaty topics so try to reach the location as fast as you can</p> <p>[Talk 1]<br/>Topic: Knative<br/>Speaker: Mete Atamel, Senior Developer Advocate - Google Cloud<br/>Mete is a Developer Advocate at Google, focused on helping developers with Google Cloud. As a long-time Java and C# developer, he likes to compare the two ecosystems. Prior to Google, he worked at Microsoft, Skype, Adobe, EMC, and Nokia building apps and services on various web, mobile and cloud platforms. Originally from the island of Cyprus, he currently lives in Greenwich of London, not too far away from the prime meridian.</p> <p>Sypnosis: When you build a serverless app, you either tie yourself to a cloud provider, or you end up building your own serverless stack. Knative provides a better choice. Knative extends Kubernetes to provide a set of middleware components (build, serving, events) for modern, source-centric, and container-based apps that can run anywhere. In this talk, we’ll see how we can use Knative primitives to build a serverless app that utilizes the Machine Learning magic of the cloud.</p> <p>[Talk 2]<br/>Topic: Devops, Secops &amp; QA - and its future consolidation for commercial software<br/>Speaker: Eugene Cheah, CTO &amp; cofounder at Uilicious<br/>Been working for over 12 years on various web technologies, and throwing them into production.<br/>Now with a focus on automating user journey web testing of other web platforms, at scale with Uilicious. Helping companies, from startups such as Glints, to major enterprises with SAP.</p> <p>Sypnosis: Looking into a possible future where where devops, secops &amp; QA consolidates into a single delivery team, and will it mean for all of us.</p> <p>[Talk 3]<br/>Topic: Live Kubernetes Debugging with the Elastic Stack<br/>Speaker: Aravind Putrevu, Developer Advocate, Elastic</p> <p>Sypnosis: Your Kubernetes app is down.
