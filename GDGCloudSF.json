In this talk, David Szabo will introduce about an open source project to implement end-to-end encryption on top of Firebase/Firestore, making Firebase one of the most secure cloud platforms out there. End-to-End Encryption also enables healthcare apps to run encrypted chats on the platform that meet HIPAA's requirements. The talk will cover the basic principle of how an end-to-end encrypted key management works, how keys can be distributed securely between users with open source libraries and how end-users can own the keys without noticing any extra overhead. A sample iOS and Android app/source will be used to demonstrate parts of the solution and outline how HIPAA deals with data encryption.</p> <p>Talk: End to End Machine Learning<br/>Description: We will start by developing a ML model using TensorFlow, training and deploying it on Google Cloud and then finally use it to get inferences.</p> <p>About the Speakers:</p> <p>David Szabo is a Privacy activist &amp; crypto(graphy) nerd: I'm working on making and end to data breaches. In my third startup, Virgil Security, I'm building a framework for developers to simplify the implementation of perfect user privacy in healthcare, IoT and other products. Earlier in my career, I spent 12 years at Microsoft across 4 countries in various engineering, UX, business and leadership roles.</p> <p>Vikram Tiwari is the co-founder of Omni Labs based in San Francisco which aims to bring data analytics and machine learning in marketing space.
