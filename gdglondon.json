Previously, making an app realtime has been difficult to achieve and requires many engineers. In this talk, Sara will explain how you can use Firebase's realtime API to store and sync data instantly without wiring up a backend. At the end of the talk, Sara will risk it all by live coding and deploying an app with Firebase!</p> <p>2) Building responsive Web apps with Go, Polymer and Google Cloud Platform by Mandy Waite<br/>The Go programming Language continues to gain momentum amongst developers and is becoming extremely popular on Google App Engine. In this session will show how you can use the App Engine Go Cloud endpoints library to build from scratch, a service that exposes backend application functionality via a RESTful API running on the Google API infrastructure used to run Google's own APIs. We'll then look at how you can design and build a responsive frontend application that consumes this newly created API using Polymer and Web Components. We will also demonstrate how we used Web Components to build an interactive frontend for an existing Go application, the Kubernetes Container Cluster scheduler.</p> <p>3) Big Data Analytics using Google BigQuery by Nawaid Shamim<br/>Every action in today’s digital world generate a lot of data which can be essential in making important business decisions but dealing with massive datasets can be challenging. Traditional tools might not scale as the dataset continually grows. Storage requirements can grow as fast as the dataset, so downloading data to your computer's hard drive is no longer a workable approach. And it can take a long time to retrieve the right subsets of data from a traditional database query.<br/>In this session, we will analyze Big Data in the cloud with Google’s BigQuery by running fast, SQL-like queries against multi-terabyte datasets in seconds. BigQuery enables you to build the real-time data-analysis solutions you need now, while being confident that you can scale your solutions in the future.</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1425670761000,"duration":3600000,"id":"220974033","name":"Deterministic Behaviour and Performance in Trading Systems","rsvp_limit":1,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1430415000000,"local_date":"2015-04-30","local_time":"18:30","updated":1430422361000,"utc_offset":3600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":34,"venue":{"id":6525682,"name":"Campus London","lat":51.52272415161133,"lon":-0.08481699973344803,"repinned":false,"address_1":"4-5 BONHILL STREET LONDON EC2A 4BX","city":"London","country":"gb","localized_country_name":"United Kingdom"},"group":{"created":1390161704000,"name":"GDG London","id":12276992,"join_mode":"open","lat":51.52000045776367,"lon":-0.09000000357627869,"urlname":"gdglondon","who":"Members","localized_location":"London, United Kingdom","state":"17","country":"gb","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/London"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdglondon/events/220974033/","description":"<p>Registration &amp; full description:<br/><a href=\"http://www.eventbrite.com/e/deterministic-behaviour-and-performance-in-trading-systems-tickets-15865560318?aff=meetupcom\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.eventbrite.com/e/deterministic-behaviour-and-performance-in-trading-systems-tickets-15865560318?aff=meetupcom</a></p> <p>Talk<br/>====<br/>One way to model a complex event driven system is as a series of functions or state machines with the data inputs and a data output. Recording and replaying data for such state machines can help testing these systems for reliable behaviour in terms of data output and timings. It can also make restarting and upgrading a running system easier. This talk will look at how this approach is applied in high frequency trading systems.

You start with some code on your laptop and tell a server to run it. You make tweaks, update manually, and realize that you’ve committed yourself to a very imperative process. It’s manual. Inefficient. What’s worse, it’s completely unreproducible.</p> <p>So then you might turn to Docker, which solves the process-level reproducibility by packaging up a full execution environment. But once we get beyond a single machine, we need to coordinate the work across a cluster of machines -- trying to do it imperatively can quickly turn into a tangled mess! You want to declare to your cluster what you expect it to do, and have the cluster assign the resources to get it done, recover from failures, and scale easily. </p> <p>Kubernetes is a recently open sourced cluster manager and scheduler that simplifies the complex tasks of deploying and managing your application. You simply declare the desired state, and Kubernetes does the work to keep it that way. In this talk, we’ll do a hands-on demonstration of how you can move from a single Docker container to many containers running across a cluster of machines by using Kubernetes.</p> <p><b>Speaker:</b></p> <p>Nawaid Shamim is a Google Developer Expert (GDE) for Google Cloud Platform and a Systems Engineer at Sony Computer Entertainment where is architects, develop and maintain web services for various Playstation games.

We are really excited to see the new approach using Observable sequences aka Observables. Besides, the new HTTP module was released only a month ago! We will cover a basic introduction of Angular 2 followed by streams and the new HTTP API covering some basic use cases.</p> <p><b>Why Google Cloud Platform is the cloud for you </b><b>by <a href=\"http://devfest.gdg-london.com/#!/speakers/3\">Grace Mollison</a></b><br/>Google Cloud Platform is a world class platform for running all sorts of applications. In this session learn about the philosophy behind Google Cloud Platform and why it is 'the' platform for running your application. Google is a company that has been delivering internet scale solutions like search, Gmail etc for years and are always looking at ways to make developers more productive. This Session will explain how by using Google Cloud Platform you can become as productive as Google developers.</p> <p><b>Give your users superpowers in the real world <i>by <a href=\"http://devfest.gdg-london.com/#!/speakers/4\">Hoi Lam</a></i></b><br/>People no longer need to sit at a desk to get the benefits of technology. You can now build experiences that work seamlessly between the digital world and the real world. Superpowers that would not have been possible, too complex or prohibitively expensive are now possible. Join this session for the latest update from Google on the platform components now available.</p> <p><b>Hooked on HTTP/2: Building services with gRPC </b><i><b>by</b> </i><a href=\"http://devfest.gdg-london.com/#!/speakers/5\"><b><i>Mandy Waite</i></b> </a><br/>gRPC is a language-neutral, platform-neutral RPC framework and toolset which is based on the finalized HTTP/2 standard and developed and open sourced by Google. It can be used to build highly performant, scalable APIs by allowing developers to define services using a powerful binary serialization toolset and language called Protocol Buffers. It can also be used to generate idiomatic client and server stubs from service definitions written in a variety of languages. In this session you’ll learn all about gRPC and how it benefits from being based on HTTP/2 and through the use of a working demo and detailed code examples you’ll learn how to build gRPC enabled microservices and clients.</p> <p><b>Progressive Web Apps and Push Notifications <i>by <a href=\"http://devfest.gdg-london.com/#!/speakers/6\">Peter Beverloo</a></i></b><br/>There have historically been significant differences between native apps and the Mobile Web in regards to performance, capabilities and user expectations. On Android, Web apps live in the browser, while native apps are everywhere. In this session you will learn about Progressive Web Apps, Push Notifications and other recent changes in Chrome that enable you to deliver rich and integrated experiences that delight your users.</p> <p><b>Building for the next billion users <i>by <a href=\"http://devfest.gdg-london.com/#!/speakers/7\">Sam Dutton</a></i></b><br/>The next billion users who are coming online for the first time aren’t restricted to any particular region: they’re in the Americas, EMEA, and APAC. As developers, we want to build for everyone — and we need to make sure the 'next billion users' can rely on our products and services. In this session you will learn how to design apps and sites for any context where connectivity is flakey, bandwidth is limited, or data is prohibitively expensive.</p> <p><b>What’s my car thinking? - A different type of mobile computing </b><i><b>by</b> </i><a href=\"http://devfest.gdg-london.com/#!/speakers/8\"><b><i>Steven Gray</i></b></a><br/>We have all heard in the news of the rise of car manufacturers lying to drivers about their car's performance, but what happens if you own an old car? Do you even have or use a car in London? If not then you might not care. Anyway, come and find out how I used an Android phone, an embedded bluetooth sensor, Google Maps and a whole load of Google Cloud Services to figure out what was happening under the hood. Plus, for an extra bonus, we will go into detail of some the Easter Eggs and features that now available in Google Maps App as well as some other fun things you might not know about Google Maps. You'll never look at a Google map the same way again!</p> <p>And thanks to our wonderful sponsors - Google and CodeNode/Skillmatter.</p> <p><b>Please register <a href=\"https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/7485-gdg-devfest-london-2015#overview\">here</a>, Meetup RSVP will not guarantee a place.</b></p> <p><i>Contact <a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]</a> if you have any questions.<br/></i></p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1457478729000,"duration":10800000,"id":"jrxhrlyvfbwb","name":"Android Study Jam","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1458237600000,"local_date":"2016-03-17","local_time":"18:00","updated":1458284687000,"utc_offset":0,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":14,"venue":{"id":24107105,"name":"Skills Matter at CodeNode","lat":51.51890563964844,"lon":-0.08661100268363953,"repinned":false,"address_1":"10 South Place, EC2M 7EB","city":"London","country":"gb","localized_country_name":"United Kingdom"},"group":{"created":1390161704000,"name":"GDG London","id":12276992,"join_mode":"open","lat":51.52000045776367,"lon":-0.09000000357627869,"urlname":"gdglondon","who":"Members","localized_location":"London, United Kingdom","state":"17","country":"gb","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/London"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdglondon/events/jrxhrlyvfbwb/","description":"<p><b>What are Study Jams </b></p> <p>Google Developers Study Jams is a free series of global, community-run, in-person study groups.

We’ll see how they work, what we can do with them and how they can help us in making our code look more synchronous and easier to manage. We’ll also briefly discuss about the interaction with existing code and we’ll take a look at some of the “crazy” things that such a powerful tool allows us to do. The talk will be mainly focused on Android, but many of the concepts could probably be useful also in other platforms where Kotlin coroutines are available.</p> <p>Speaker : Andrea Bresolin - Android Engineer at The App Business (TAB)</p> <p>The State of Kotlin<br/>Over the last three months I ran a survey of the global Kotlin ecosystem. My goal was to learn how developers use and adopt Kotlin - either in work or side projects, or just for playing around, and what are some of the most popular resources for learning it.</p> <p>The survey was a great success, and gained over 2400 responses in total! The results are meant to become a resource for the Kotlin community. Something we can all look at for interesting insights that will also help drive adoption of Kotlin in our teams and organisations.</p> <p>To give you a taster, here’s a few questions I asked in the survey:<br/>- How big is Android as a proportion of all Kotlin developers<br/>- Are people happy naming libraries and tooling with K<br/>- What are the favourite features of the language<br/>- What kind of DSLs are people building with Kotlin and for what use-cases<br/>In my talk will answer all these questions, and more. But be warned, some answers might surprise you.</p> <p>Speaker : Zan Markan - Developer Evangelist @Pusher</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1527110906000,"duration":7200000,"id":"251053811","name":"Google I/O Recap - Lightning Talks","rsvp_limit":35,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1527786000000,"local_date":"2018-05-31","local_time":"18:00","updated":1527842981000,"utc_offset":3600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":39,"venue":{"id":25840313,"name":"WeWork Moorgate","lat":51.5181770324707,"lon":-0.09054499864578247,"repinned":false,"address_1":"1 Fore St Ave","city":"London","country":"gb","localized_country_name":"United Kingdom"},"group":{"created":1390161704000,"name":"GDG London","id":12276992,"join_mode":"open","lat":51.52000045776367,"lon":-0.09000000357627869,"urlname":"gdglondon","who":"Members","localized_location":"London, United Kingdom","state":"17","country":"gb","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/London"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdglondon/events/251053811/","description":"<p>Come join us for the Google I/O Recap lightning talks!

Don't forget to wear your ugly / festive jumper! Thanks to Revolut for providing the venue, food and drinks for this Meetup!</p> <p>TALK 01 - Rx DATA FLOW in REVOLUT's ANDROID APP</p> <p>Revolut's app is a rather thick client full of local data and logic. We’ll show how we are handling that using RxJava, how data in the app comes from different sources, flows into business logic entities, being transformed there, and finally reaches the UI.</p> <p>This talk will be given by Roman Iatcyna.<br/>Roman is a Lead Android engineer who joined Revolut 3 years ago.</p> <p>TALK 02 - BDD IN ANDROID USING CUCUMBER</p> <p>BDD is an Agile software development process that encourages collaboration among developers, QA and non-technical or business participants in a software project. In this talk we will cover the principles of BDD, then as we move on we will write some plain-text descriptions of the desired behaviours, and finally we will test them using Cucumber and Espresso.</p> <p>This talk will be delivered by 2 engineers from Booking.com.</p> <p>Matteo Pasotti<br/>Matteo is an Android Engineer at Booking.com with 5 years' experience. He's passionate about Kotlin and Design, including everything about layouts and animations. He also enjoys sharing his knowledge with others by writing articles and tutorials.</p> <p>Daniel Smart<br/>Daniel is a Test Engineering Lead at BookingGo, working with teams across the web application - coaching &amp; guiding both testers &amp; developers to deliver a quality product in a timely manner.</p> <p>Outside of testing, he has a wild enthusiasm for Python, Security Testing (especially left-shifting ownership and responsibility back into the teams), and crazy-loud shirts.</p> <p>TALK 03 - REUSING SCREENS</p> <p>If you ever worked with an app containing more than 10 screens, you have most likely had at least 2 of these screens looking similar or almost the same.</p> <p>Usually, you just extract one base class and override something to have different logic or UI. However, imagine that this screen is reused in 10 different places with quite diverse contexts. Our application contains 300+ screens and we are working with dozens of similar issues. In this talk, we want to share the key things we've learned resolving them.</p> <p>This talk will be given by Igor Ismagilov.<br/>Igor is a Lead Android engineer who joined Revolut more than two years ago. During this time he has been working on a wide range of features that are visible to users or installed under the hood.</p> ","how_to_find_us":"The nearest tube station is Canary Wharf","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false}],"upcoming":[],"organizers":[{"id":48288292,"name":"Gen A.","status":"active","joined":1337326928000,"city":"London","country":"gb","localized_country_name":"United Kingdom","state":"17","lat":51.46,"lon":-0.21,"photo":{"id":243213462,"highres_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/8/2/b/6/highres_243213462.jpeg","photo_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/8/2/b/6/member_243213462.jpeg","thumb_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/8/2/b/6/thumb_243213462.jpeg","type":"member","base_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com"},"group_profile":{"status":"active","visited":1579587399000,"created":1390468128000,"updated":1575960605000,"role":"organizer","group":{"id":12276992,"urlname":"gdglondon","name":"GDG London","status":"active","who":"Members","members":2685,"join_mode":"open","localized_location":"London, United Kingdom","group_photo":{"id":481323317,"highres_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/f/5/highres_481323317.jpeg","photo_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/f/5/600_481323317.jpeg","thumb_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/f/5/thumb_481323317.jpeg","type":"event","base_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com"}},"intro":"Lead, GDG London\r\n(GDG stands for Google Developer Group)\r\nAmbassador, Google Women Techmakers","link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdglondon/members/48288292/"},"is_pro_admin":false},{"id":74599702,"name":"Goran M.","status":"active","joined":1357214447000,"city":"London","country":"gb","localized_country_name":"United Kingdom","state":"17","lat":51.52,"lon":-0.1,"photo":{"id":296619581,"highres_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/9/a/9/d/highres_296619581.jpeg","photo_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/9/a/9/d/member_296619581.jpeg","thumb_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/9/a/9/d/thumb_296619581.jpeg","type":"member","base_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com"},"group_profile":{"status":"active","visited":1580839017000,"created":1511127389000,"updated":1579545807000,"role":"coorganizer","group":{"id":12276992,"urlname":"gdglondon","name":"GDG London","status":"active","who":"Members","members":2685,"join_mode":"open","localized_location":"London, United Kingdom","group_photo":{"id":481323317,"highres_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/f/5/highres_481323317.jpeg","photo_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/f/5/600_481323317.jpeg","thumb_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/f/5/thumb_481323317.jpeg","type":"event","base_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com"}},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdglondon/members/74599702/"},"is_pro_admin":false},{"id":191424116,"name":"Mamata G.","bio":"An Android geek!
