Will \"Big Brother\" read our thoughts and hack our brains? </p> <p>In this part, we will dive into the future of thought as input for wearable devices with real-world examples and code. Demonstrations will be shown using the Emotiv EPOC headset, a high resolution, neuro-signal acquisition and processing wireless neuroheadset that uses a set of sensors to tune into electric signals produced by the brain to detect thoughts, feelings and expressions. This device is about to be superseded by a new generation of neuroheadsets that interface directly with Android devices via Bluetooth.  You will see the EEG neuroheadset and brain-computer interface with examples of interfacing with desktop, mobile and wearable apps. A volunteer will use the headset and some custom software to control a Parrot AR.Drone quadricopter.</p> <p>We will dive into the roots of the technology, showing code and examples along with big pictures of the technology.

By focusing on solving end-user problems, our work can address enormously complex challenges. Do do this, we have to be solution driven, focused on the core business, and able to iterate fast to produce code that differentiates itself from others.</p> <p>Today, we have the power of massive data centers around the world at our finger tips, but many developers are still dealing with local machine problems! What does the world look like if you don't need to directly interact with individual machines? What can be accomplished without having to lay a keystroke in a remote server shell? What type of software and features can you deliver if you don't have to write all the backends yourself?</p> <p>This session will demonstrate what technologies on the Google Cloud Platform bring to the table.

OpenID Connect (OIDC) is built on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. It allows clients to verify the identity of the user and, as well as to obtain their basic profile information.</p> <p>This session covers how OAuth/OIDC works, when to use them, and frameworks/services that simplify authentication.</p> <p>Matt Raible is a Java Champion, Web Developer, and Developer Advocate at Okta.

No programming experience is required, but if you have a laptop you might want to bring it along.</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1564018200000,"duration":28800000,"id":"263441485","name":"DevFest Fairgrounds: Build your own Google Action","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1568473200000,"local_date":"2019-09-14","local_time":"09:00","rsvp_close_offset":"PT20H","updated":1568508507000,"utc_offset":-21600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":49,"venue":{"id":26134726,"name":"Google 2930 Pearl","lat":40.02202224731445,"lon":-105.25484466552734,"repinned":true,"address_1":"2930 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"80301","state":"CO"},"group":{"created":1390181493000,"name":"Google Developer Group Boulder","id":12284642,"join_mode":"open","lat":40.040000915527344,"lon":-105.30999755859375,"urlname":"Google-Developer-Group-Boulder","who":"Google Developers","localized_location":"Boulder, CO","state":"CO","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Mountain"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/Google-Developer-Group-Boulder/events/263441485/","description":"<p>~ Joint event with GDG Northern Colorado ~</p> <p>Come to DevFest Fairgrounds for a fun day of hands-on coding to learn some cool new Google tech!</p> <p>Watch a summary video of last year's event to get a taste: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnRLpP_ulng\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnRLpP_ulng</a></p> <p>Note: Limited spots available to room capacity.

Which means Flutter should be ready for production use on the web, right? It's still early days. Is it really ready for prime time? In this talk we'll discuss the good and the not so good of using Flutter for your website. We'll also discuss the progress Flutter and Dart have made in general throughout the year.</p> <p>Agenda<br/>=====<br/>6:45 PM Doors Open<br/>7:00 PM Talk<br/>8:00 PM Mingle<br/>8:15 PM Doors Close</p> <p>Parking<br/>=====<br/>Visitor parking at the Google building is located in front of the towers.
