It all started in modding games, which led to accidentally generating meaningful revenue and now globally scaling products &amp; teams internationally. Altogether made Joseph a hands-on technical leader and entrepreneur.<br/>Born and bred in Silicon Valley, Joseph now spends his time between San Francisco and Hong Kong leading companies and teams to build amazing products that most people dare not to face. Everything from real-money gaming in India tasting 600M USD in transactions per year to developer tools that transform software teams to safely release ideas/products/apps/websites faster. Joseph enjoys extremely challenging tech problems that require brilliant, fun and passionate teams of people to unite towards a single vision.<br/>As of late, Joseph's becoming an expert in Go, Kubernetes, Docker, and GraphQL but previously mastered Unity3D, .net/core, and Java. Including low-level distributed computing &amp; high concurrency TCP/UDP programming to high-level multi-region data architecture design.</p> <p>#GDGCloudHK #GDGCloud #GDGHK</p> <p>Organizers:<br/>GDG Cloud Hong Kong</p> <p>Venue Support:<br/>Google Hong Kong</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false}],"upcoming":[],"organizers":[{"id":264636821,"name":"Guan W.","status":"active","joined":1538535598000,"city":"Hong Kong","country":"hk","localized_country_name":"Hong Kong","lat":22.27,"lon":114.14,"photo":{"id":283450060,"highres_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/2/7/4/c/highres_283450060.jpeg","photo_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/2/7/4/c/member_283450060.jpeg","thumb_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/2/7/4/c/thumb_283450060.jpeg","type":"member","base_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com"},"group_profile":{"status":"active","visited":1571366353000,"created":1571366353000,"updated":1571373670000,"role":"coorganizer","group":{"id":32468011,"urlname":"GDG-Cloud-Hong-Kong","name":"GDG Cloud Hong Kong","status":"active","who":"Members","members":234,"join_mode":"open","localized_location":"Hong Kong, Hong Kong"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Cloud-Hong-Kong/members/264636821/"},"is_pro_admin":false},{"id":277328698,"name":"Leonardo L.","status":"active","joined":1553494753000,"city":"Hong Kong","country":"hk","localized_country_name":"Hong Kong","lat":22.27,"lon":114.14,"photo":{"id":286440877,"highres_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/3/6/d/highres_286440877.jpeg","photo_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/3/6/d/member_286440877.jpeg","thumb_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/3/6/d/thumb_286440877.jpeg","type":"member","base_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com"},"group_profile":{"status":"active","visited":1574405518000,"created":1564029001000,"updated":1564029285000,"role":"organizer","group":{"id":32468011,"urlname":"GDG-Cloud-Hong-Kong","name":"GDG Cloud Hong Kong","status":"active","who":"Members","members":234,"join_mode":"open","localized_location":"Hong Kong, Hong Kong"},"intro":"Joint our events and ask me more","link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Cloud-Hong-Kong/members/277328698/"},"is_pro_admin":false},{"id":285985779,"name":"Kitson C.","status":"active","joined":1564109311000,"city":"Hong Kong","country":"hk","localized_country_name":"Hong Kong","lat":22.27,"lon":114.14,"photo":{"id":290745058,"highres_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/b/0/0/2/highres_290745058.jpeg","photo_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/b/0/0/2/member_290745058.jpeg","thumb_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/b/0/0/2/thumb_290745058.jpeg","type":"member","base_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com"},"group_profile":{"status":"active","visited":1568023027000,"created":1564110669000,"updated":1564193507000,"role":"coorganizer","group":{"id":32468011,"urlname":"GDG-Cloud-Hong-Kong","name":"GDG Cloud Hong Kong","status":"active","who":"Members","members":234,"join_mode":"open","localized_location":"Hong Kong, Hong Kong"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Cloud-Hong-Kong/members/285985779/"},"is_pro_admin":false}]}
