This coincides with a Global Android Dev Camp happening the same weekend over Google+ Hangouts. Android developers from all over the world come together at more than 50 locations and write app code - nonstop! Globally, about 1,000 developers are expected - from Brussels to Berlin, to Warsaw and London, to Brazzaville, Kyoto and San Diego.</p> <p><b>Learn about hands-on Android app development</b> The event will include a beginner-level jumpstart session on the major features of Android, focused on 4.0 development, Fragments, and releasing to the Market. Android enthusiasts will be on hand to help and to answer questions throughout the weekend.  <b>Build with Us or Build Your Own</b> Throughout the weekend, other GTUG members, locally or globally, will be building Android apps and sharing the code with you so you can code along. If, on the other hand, you already have a great idea for what to build, bring that idea with you to the hackathon, pitch it in the morning and form a team. Even better, bring along anything you can prepare ahead of time (sketches, designs, mockups, an empty template app etc.) and use the time, information and talented people provided at the hackathon to develop your idea into a working application. At the end of the day, we'll invite you to share your Android app with the world.  <b>What Do I Need?</b> We will provide facilities and experts to help you learn to use Android and write your application. Just bring your laptop, ideas, absolute concentration and enthusiasm to complete the mix.  <b>When?</b> The Brussels hackathon will take place Saturday and Sunday, February 18th and 19th, from 10:00(am) to 03:00(am) on Saturday, and from 09:00(am) to 08:00(pm) on Sunday. The location will not allow us to stay the night, so this will not be required or provided, but you are free to continue your work overnight at your own location. The deadline to finish your hack is Sunday 18:00.  <b>Where?</b> It will be held at <a href=\"http://www.outpost.be/website/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=27&amp;Itemid=48\">Outpost GameCenter, Rue de la Tribune 8, Brussel</a>: This location is accessible via train or metro via Central Station or Madou, and some limited street parking should be possible for cars.

Some of them write apps, that are to be used by enterprises \u2013 both employees and customers. Often those apps are in one way or another connected to enterprise systems, and need to find their place in the whole enterprise application/software landscape. This is no easy task.</p> <p>All of a sudden us, builders of fun apps, need to comply with standards, need to use version control, continuous integration and the like. Our apps are tested by people who do not only look at the \u201cwow\u201d factor, but who thoroughly look at functionality \u2013 and whether the app is built in accordance with the requirements\u2026 Our apps need to comply with lots of \u2013ilities (availability, maintainability, reliability, testability etc.).People from the operations team want to be able to exactly know what influence the app will have on diverse resources. All of a sudden building apps has become work\u2026</p> <p>In my presentation I would like to address some of the aforementioned topics, especially where the process differs from the \u201ctraditional\u201d software lifecycle management process. This traditional process will be described shortly, to give the audience the necessary context. Then I will zoom in on the differences between traditional SLMP and Android SLMP. First (shortly) on requirements \u2013 especially what is special about apps, on architecture and development (main focus), and why you need standardization, quality, security etc., but also the tools to use. After that (again shortly) testing, administration, maintenance etc.</p> <p>This is not meant to be a static presentation, but \u2013 when the allotted time slot allows it \u2013 there will be a demonstration of how this whole process (as far as tooling is concerned) could work, and why we chose this tooling etc.</p> <p><b>Mylène Reiners</b></p> <p><a href=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/b/4/event_83880692.jpegMylène\" class=\"linkified\">http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/b/4/event_83880692.jpegMylène</a> has been employed in the field of ICT since 1988, and gained experience in lots of technologies and roles. Currently she works at Atos Nederland B.V. in Eindhoven, and spends almost all of her time working as a software architect and as Dutch competence lead for Java EE and Android. Besides that, her interest is centered around software quality and software security, software craftsmanship and agile, SaaS and Open Source and Open Standards. She tries to keep up-to-date with all of those interests, mostly conceptual, sometimes by going hands-on.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><b>Securely Storing Secrets on Android Devices</b></p> <p>Services such as Twitter use OAuth to allow their users to grant us - the developers of apps - access to their resources. We in turn use twitter or other identity providers for authenticating our users and give them access to our own APIs. This triangular relationship requires trust between everybody involved.</p> <p>While in theory this is great, in practice we run into a lot of issues. Many developers store their consumer secrets inside an app, basically placing the keys to the kingdom in user's hands and trust the Android security model to protect these keys. The alternatives, ranging from dynamically exchanging token secrets to building custom proxies can be complicated, especially for app developers that just want to focus on the app, without having to worry about custom backend APIs.</p> <p>In this talk, we will look at the security implications of the app, API and third party services love triangle and look at ways to improve security without compromising usability. The talk mixes theory with practical examples.</p> <p><b>Ivo Jansch</b></p> <p><a href=\"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/2/7/a/event_90333402.jpegIvo\" class=\"linkified\">http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/2/7/a/event_90333402.jpegIvo</a> Jansch is one of the founders of Egeniq.com, a mobile technology company based in Utrecht.

Although demands for data handling are growing at a very fast rate, we are still left with basic database access and ill defined classes for data synchronisation. Based on significant Android enterprise experience, combined with insight of other software frameworks, we are building an enterprise ORM and synchronisation framework. We tried to follow the Android architecture guidelines as strict as possible, while leaving space for generic streamlined functionality.This session will discuss the challenges we encountered during our enterprise app development and will touch upon some key functionalities needed for a steady enterprise Android framework. <br/>While this is primarily a tech-talk, light is also shed on more practical concepts like out-of-market app distribution, crash reporting and our own general experiences.<br/>The main goal of this session is sharing experiences and sufficiently elegantly working solutions.</p> <p> </p> <p><b>Wouter Vegter</b></p> <p><a href=\"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/1/6/c/event_90333132.jpegWouter\" class=\"linkified\">http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/1/6/c/event_90333132.jpegWouter</a> Vegter, Android consultant and developer, is working with Android since 2009 with his company Moop.me.

You need an intermediate level in Java or general Object Oriented (OO) programming to get the most out of this workshop. Don't be afraid to join if you are lacking in this area, we'll help you out before or during the workshop.</p> <p>We will begin with a general presentation on Android architecture and key concepts. Then it's up to you to walk through a series of four labs (on your own laptop) to reach the goal of creating a complete Android app. There will be a couple of experienced Android developers walking around to answer your questions or help you out when you get stuck. We will give you some hints and tips on useful Android tools and you'll get the change to win a copy of \"Professional Android 2 Application Development\" by Reto Meier, or one of two e-books by Manning and other swag.</p> <p>The meetup charge of \u20ac15 is purely for coffee / thee, drinks, snacks and dinner (which will be sandwiches or pizza or some other simple dinner).</p> <p><b>The schedule:</b></p> <p>16.00: Walk-in with coffee / thee, drinks and snacks.<br/>16.30: Presentation Android architecture and key concepts</p> <p>17:00: Workshop lab1 &amp; lab2<br/>18.00: Dinner break</p> <p>19.00: Workshop lab3 &amp; lab4<br/>20.30: Drinks &amp; snacks</p> <p>21:00: End</p> <p><b>Prerequisites (important!)</b></p> <p>To be prepared you need to install the following software and execute the <a href=\"http://files.meetup.com/2687312/Android%20Lab%20Primer.pdf\">Android Lab primer</a>. This to simply test your Android development environment and because we cannot guarantee we have a good Wifi connection at the workshop location (and downloads can be several hundreds of megabytes). If you have any trouble or questions on any of the installations below let me know and we'll work it out together.</p> <p><b>Java Development Kit (JDK) 6 (</b><a href=\"http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk-6u31-download-1501634.html\"><b>download</b></a><b>)</b></p> <p>You can develop Android apps in a couple of languages, but for most apps Java is the preferred language. You need a Java Development Kit (JDK) to develop Android apps. A Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is not sufficient.</p> <p><b>Android Software Development Kit (Android SDK) - release 18 (</b><a href=\"http://developer.android.com/sdk\"><b>download</b></a> <b>and</b> <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing.html\"><b>install</b></a><b>)</b></p> <p>The Android Software Development Kit (SDK) is the base kit you need to be able to be able to build and package Android apps. Apart from the Android Framework (where you build your Android app against) the SDK provides you with a lot of tooling to run and test your app on your development system. For instance the SDK comes with an Android emulator which you can use to emulate all kinds of hardware. For the workshop you need to configure at least one Android Virtual Device (AVD), as these emulated devices are called, or you can simply develop apps on your own Android smartphone or tablet (and please, do bring them along!).</p> <p>After downloading the Android SDK it is important that you at least install 1 Android platform (see<a href=\"http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing.html#AddingComponents\">step 4 of the installation instructions</a>). For the workshop we use the latest platform (Ice Cream Sandwich, version 4.0.3) and maybe an old smartphone version (2.3.3) just in case, but the app should run fine on any platform, since we will be using the very basic stuff. Tip, also install the platform-tools, documentation, samples and the source code. These will come in handy when you want to know how Google has solved things in the framework itself.</p> <p><b>Eclipse 3.6 (Helios) or 3.7 (Indigo) (</b><a href=\"http://www.eclipse.org/downloads\"><b>download</b></a><b>)</b></p> <p>Eclipse is the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) which is best suited for Android development, and which we will be using for the workshop. Simply download the latest (3.7.2 a.k.a. Indigo) Eclipse IDE for Java Developers and you are all set.</p> <p><b>Eclipse Android Development Tools (ADT) plugin - release 18 (</b><b><a href=\"http://developer.android.com/sdk/eclipse-adt.html#installing\">download and install</a></b><b>)</b></p> <p>This is a plugin for Eclipse which basically makes the Android tools from the Android SDK available in Eclipse and makes your job as Android developer a lot easier. We will spend some time on the tools available in the ADT plugin in the first exercise.</p> <p><b>Test your setup</b></p> <p>Finally we want to ask you to create a simple \"Hello, world\" Android project in Eclipse to test your setup. You can use the <a href=\"http://files.meetup.com/2687312/Android%20Lab%20Primer.pdf\">Android Lab primer</a>, which is a shorter (and hopefully easier) write up of the<a href=\"http://developer.android.com/resources/tutorials/hello-world.html\">Hello, World</a> exercise by Google, but both should do the job. If you have a running \"Hello, world\" app you are all set for next week!</p> <p><b>Final notes</b></p> <p>The Android Workshop is aimed at intermediate Java developers with little to no Android knowledge. If you are lacking Java or general OO programming skills this workshop will be a real challenge. We still think it will give you a jump start if you really want to start Android development. A couple of experienced Android developers will be walking around if you have any questions during the workshop. The workshop fee is \u20ac15,- euros. This basically boils down to \u20ac5,- for coffee / tea, other drinks and snacks (which we'll buy up front). The other \u20ac10,- is for your own pizza / pasta or chinese dish (we'll decide what to eat at the workshop). So if you fancy <i>super-large-extra-toppings-pan-pizza's</i> costing \u20ac25 euros please bring along some extra cash. Please bring all your Android devices, books and other cool stuff you would like to show off or use during the workshop. And if you won't be using them maybe your workshop neighbor is interested in using them during the workshop. We have a couple of people on the waiting list. If you already know you can't come please RSVP \"No\" so others can come in your stead. This workshop is part of the <a href=\"http://appril.nl\">Appril</a> initiative. Hope to see you in Appril!</p> <p>Johan Pelgrim</p> <p>P.S. <i>Yes</i>, this is the same workshop as I've given several time last year at VX Company, so feel free to attend again, but you probably won't learn anything new ;-)</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1336050445000,"duration":18000000,"id":"63236452","name":"Dutch Android Open Space","rsvp_limit":50,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1339079400000,"local_date":"2012-06-07","local_time":"16:30","updated":1340786440000,"utc_offset":7200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":29,"venue":{"id":4285392,"name":"VX Company IT Services","lat":52.218101501464844,"lon":5.301907062530518,"repinned":false,"address_1":"Baarnsche dijk 8, 3741 LR","city":"Baarn","country":"nl","localized_country_name":"Netherlands"},"group":{"created":1319226806000,"name":"The Dutch Android User Group","id":2687312,"join_mode":"open","lat":52.099998474121094,"lon":5.110000133514404,"urlname":"dutch-aug","who":"Daugians","localized_location":"Utrecht, Netherlands","state":"","country":"nl","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Amsterdam"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/dutch-aug/events/63236452/","manual_attendance_count":25,"description":"<p><a href=\"http://blog.dutchaug.org/meetups/images/Dutch-Android-Open-Space-2.png\"><img src=\"http://blog.dutchaug.org/meetups/images/Dutch-Android-Open-Space-2.png\" /></a></p> <p><b>Introduction</b></p> <p>If you are familiar with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology\">Open Space</a> meetups you know how valuable these type of meetups can be. It is very open, highly active and interactive. Always aiming to discuss, distill and find solutions for the most interesting topics, information and challenges which you are facing every day, in your role as Android professional. This could very well be the most interesting meetup yet, so join sooner rather than later!</p> <p><b>Theme: <i>\"Together we can build awesome apps!\"</i></b></p> <p>If you are working on mobile projects you know that time-to-market is often short. The client wants to have the best looking app and your end-users deserve the best user experience. How do you create an awesome Android app in such a short time frame and still keep smiling? How can we work together? What have you learned along the way and what is still a big hurdle to take, every time you start an Android project? Do you re-use components? And how do you build, test and deploy your app? All fair questions and hopefully disclosing the Open Space theme before the meetup will get you more excited to join the conversation.</p> <p><b>Skills in our group...</b></p> <p>All kind of roles and skills are represented in our group. From entrepreneurs to testers, graphics designers to architects and of course a fair amount of developers. We need each other to build better apps and this need is clearer than ever in our every day challenge to meet the deadline on some Android project and creating awesome user experiences while we are at it.</p> <p><b>Rich Hyndmann opening keynote</b></p> <p><a href=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/9/8/c/event_118255692.jpegWe\" class=\"linkified\">http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/9/8/c/event_118255692.jpegWe</a> are very excited to announce that no one less than Google Android Developer Advocate and DutchAUG supporter <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/115995639636688350464\">Rich Hyndmann</a> will open the Open Space meetup via an On Air hangout. In an inspirational keynote Rich will share his vision on how we can build awesome apps.

After that we will explain the chosen Open Space process:</p> <p>We will have a large bord with empty time slots. Everybody will have a chance to write down a topic of interest in one of these time slots. (Of course, nothing holds you back to already think about or even prepare a topic you would like to see discussed). If we have more topics then time slots we will either open an extra breakout room, or simply vote on which topics we want to cover. After that we breakout in 30 minute sessions to discuss the top-voted topics. One person, per group, is asked to present what was discussed and possibly some answers, best practices or results.

Either you are doing something wrong, or the Android Framework is... (probably the latter ;-). It's sometimes hard to find the right, or simply <i>a good</i> solution to program challenges you face every day. In this meetup we want to train these skills by presenting you with some simple to really challenging <i>Android Code Puzzlers</i> to real-life Android programming situations. At the end of the evening you will be a more savvy Android programmer with a few new tricks up your sleeve ;-)</p> <p><b>Example puzzles</b></p> <p>Example 1 (2 points): \"<i>Name 5 different ways to handle a button click in an Activity.</i>\"</p> <p>Example 2 (5 points): \"<i>When I scroll to the top of the bottom of my ListView I see a blue vagueness popping in and out. How can you turn this off?</i>\"</p> <p>Example 3 (10 points): \"<i>You create and execute an AsyncTask within the doInBackground method from another AsyncTask... Great solution, right? Or maybe not so great... What happens and why? How could you solve this?</i>\"</p> <p>We will present many of these kind of puzzlers which you will solve in small teams. When you register for this meetup we ask you for you Android programming skill level (beginner / intermediate / expert), this to create equally levelled teams. Good answers will score some points for your team, which at the end of the evening might result in some well earned prizes, but more importantly, <i>eternal fame</i>.</p> <p><b>Note</b>: If you have a interesting code challenge which suits this meetup fine please send it to [masked] (Thanks in advance!)</p> <p><b>Tips &amp; Tricks</b></p> <p>In the second half of this meetup we want to present you with our tips and tricks in how to setup an Android project, create project resources, present you with useful libraries, frameworks and tools we use to implement certain features in our Android apps. In return we would like to hear what you are doing to solve various day to day tasks in assembling your Android app and creating the best user experience for your users.

You need an intermediate level in Java or general Object Oriented (OO) programming to get the most out of this workshop. Don't be afraid to join if you are lacking in this area, we'll help you out before or during the workshop.</p> <p>We will begin with a general presentation on Android architecture and key concepts. Then it's up to you to walk through a series of four labs (on your own laptop) to reach the goal of creating a complete Android app. There will be a couple of experienced Android developers walking around to answer your questions or help you out when you get stuck. We will give you some hints and tips on useful Android tools and you'll get the change to win print books or e-books and other swag.</p> <p><b>Important notice: You can RSVP here, but you have to buy a ticket via <a href=\"http://www.appril.nl/events/bouw-androidapp/\">the official Appril workshop page</a>!</b> The entry fee for this workshop is \u20ac30 and includes coffee / tea, drinks, snacks and pizza.</p> <p><b>The schedule:</b></p> <p>16.30: Walk-in with coffee / thee, drinks and snacks.<br/>17:00: Presentation Android architecture and key concepts</p> <p>17:30: Workshop lab1 &amp; lab2<br/>18.30: Pizza break</p> <p>19.00: Workshop lab3 &amp; lab4<br/>20.30: Drinks &amp; snacks</p> <p>21:00: End</p> <p><b>Prerequisites (important!)</b></p> <p>To be prepared you need to install the following software and execute the <a href=\"http://files.meetup.com/2687312/Android%20Lab%20Primer.pdf\">Android Lab primer</a>. This to simply test your Android development environment and because we cannot guarantee we have a good Wifi connection at the workshop location (and downloads can be several hundreds of megabytes). If you have any trouble or questions on any of the installations below let me know and we'll work it out together.</p> <p><b>Java Development Kit (JDK) 6 (</b><a href=\"http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk6downloads-1902814.html\"><b>download</b></a><b>)</b></p> <p>You can develop Android apps in a couple of languages, but for most apps Java is the preferred language. You need a Java Development Kit (JDK) to develop Android apps. A Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is not sufficient.</p> <p><b>Android Software Development Kit (Android SDK) - release 21 (</b><a href=\"http://developer.android.com/sdk\"><b>download</b></a> <b>and</b> <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing.html\"><b>install</b></a><b>)</b></p> <p>The Android Software Development Kit (SDK) is the base kit you need to be able to be able to build and package Android apps. Apart from the Android Framework (where you build your Android app against) the SDK provides you with a lot of tooling to run and test your app on your development system. For instance the SDK comes with an Android emulator which you can use to emulate all kinds of hardware. For the workshop you need to configure at least one Android Virtual Device (AVD), as these emulated devices are called, or you can simply develop apps on your own Android smartphone or tablet (and please, do bring them along!).</p> <p>After downloading the Android SDK it is important that you at least install 1 Android platform (see <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/adding-packages.html\">\"Adding Components\"</a>). For the workshop we use the latest platform (Jelly Bean 4.2.2 API 17) and maybe an old smartphone version (2.3.3) just in case, but the app should run fine on any platform, since we will be using the very basic stuff. Tip, also install the platform-tools, documentation, samples and the source code. These will come in handy when you want to know how Google has solved things in the framework itself.</p> <p><b>Eclipse 4.2 (Juno) (</b><a href=\"http://www.eclipse.org/downloads\"><b>download</b></a><b>)</b></p> <p>Eclipse is the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) which is best suited for Android development, and which we will be using for the workshop. Simply download the latest (4.2 a.k.a. Juno) Eclipse IDE for Java Developers and you are all set.</p> <p><b>Eclipse Android Development Tools (ADT) plugin - release 21 (</b><b><a href=\"http://developer.android.com/sdk/eclipse-adt.html#installing\">download and install</a></b><b>)</b></p> <p>This is a plugin for Eclipse which basically makes the Android tools from the Android SDK available in Eclipse and makes your job as Android developer a lot easier. We will spend some time on the tools available in the ADT plugin in the first exercise.</p> <p><b>Test your setup</b></p> <p>Finally we want to ask you to create a simple \"Hello, world\" Android project in Eclipse to test your setup. You can use the <a href=\"http://files.meetup.com/2687312/Android%20Lab%20Primer.pdf\">Android Lab primer</a>, which is a shorter (and hopefully easier) write up of the \"<a href=\"http://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/index.html\">Build Your First App</a>\" tutorial by Google, but both should do the job. If you have a running \"Hello, world\" app you are all set for the workshop!</p> <p><b>Final notes</b></p> <p>The Android Workshop is aimed at intermediate Java developers with little to no Android knowledge. If you are lacking Java or general OO programming skills this workshop will be a real challenge. We still think it will give you a jump start if you really want to start Android development. A couple of experienced Android developers will be walking around if you have any questions during the workshop. Please bring all your Android devices, books and other cool stuff you would like to show off or use during the workshop. And if you won't be using them maybe your workshop neighbor is interested in using them during the workshop.

For the workshop you need to configure at least one Android Virtual Device (AVD), as these emulated devices are called, or you can simply develop apps on your own Android smartphone or tablet (and please, do bring them along!).</p> <p>After downloading the Android SDK it is important that you at least install 1 Android platform (see <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/adding-packages.html\">\"Adding Components\"</a>). For the workshop we use the latest platform (Jelly Bean 4.2.2 API 17) and maybe an old smartphone version (2.3.3) just in case, but the app should run fine on any platform, since we will be using the very basic stuff. Tip, also install the platform-tools, documentation, samples and the source code. These will come in handy when you want to know how Google has solved things in the framework itself.</p> <p><b>Eclipse 4.2 (Juno) (</b><a href=\"http://www.eclipse.org/downloads\"><b>download</b></a><b>)</b></p> <p>Eclipse is the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) which is best suited for Android development, and which we will be using for the workshop. Simply download the latest (4.2 a.k.a. Juno) Eclipse IDE for Java Developers and you are all set.</p> <p><b>Eclipse Android Development Tools (ADT) plugin - release 21 (</b><a href=\"http://developer.android.com/sdk/eclipse-adt.html#installing\"><b>download and install</b></a><b>)</b></p> <p>This is a plugin for Eclipse which basically makes the Android tools from the Android SDK available in Eclipse and makes your job as Android developer a lot easier. We will spend some time on the tools available in the ADT plugin in the first exercise.</p> <p><b>Test your setup</b></p> <p>Finally we want to ask you to create a simple \"Hello World\" Android project in Eclipse to test your setup. If you have a running \"Hello World\" app you are all set for the workshop!</p> <p><b>Final notes</b></p> <p>The Android GCM Workshop will only be fun if you bring your own Android device that is connected to the internet. We cannot guarantee we have a good Wifi connection at the workshop location. Please bring all your Android devices, books and other cool stuff you would like to show off or use during the workshop. And if you won't be using them maybe your workshop neighbor is interested in using them during the workshop. This workshop is part of the <a href=\"http://appril.nl/\">Appril</a> initiative. Hope to see you in Appril!</p> <p>Dennis Geurts &amp; Johan Pelgrim</p> <p><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/appengine/\"><img src=\"https://developers.google.com/appengine/images/appengine-silver-120x30.gif\" /></a></p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1363337566000,"duration":208800000,"id":"109379062","name":"Google I/O 2013","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1368594000000,"local_date":"2013-05-15","local_time":"07:00","updated":1368803931000,"utc_offset":7200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":8,"venue":{"id":6812482,"name":"Moscone Center","lat":37.78331756591797,"lon":-122.4026107788086,"repinned":false,"address_1":"747 Howard Street","city":"San Francisco","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"94103","state":"CA"},"group":{"created":1319226806000,"name":"The Dutch Android User Group","id":2687312,"join_mode":"open","lat":52.099998474121094,"lon":5.110000133514404,"urlname":"dutch-aug","who":"Daugians","localized_location":"Utrecht, Netherlands","state":"","country":"nl","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Amsterdam"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/dutch-aug/events/109379062/","description":"<p>The 15th until the 17th there is a gathering of sorts in the Moscone Center called Google I/O.

The client wants to have the best looking app and your end-users deserve the best user experience. How do you create an awesome Android app in such a short time frame and still keep smiling? How can we work together? What have you learned along the way and what is still a big hurdle to take, every time you start an Android project? Do you re-use components? And how do you build, test and deploy your app? All fair questions and hopefully disclosing the Open Space theme before the meetup will get you more excited to join the conversation.</p> <p><b>Skills in our group...</b></p> <p>All kind of roles and skills are represented in our group. From entrepreneurs to testers, graphics designers to architects and of course a fair amount of developers. We need each other to build better apps and this need is clearer than ever in our every day challenge to meet the deadline on some Android project and creating awesome user experiences while we are at it.</p> <p><b>Process</b></p> <p>We open the doors around 4:30pm and aim to start at 5:00pm with the opening, welcome, general announcement. After that we will explain the chosen Open Space process:</p> <p>We will have a large board with empty time slots. Everybody will have a chance to write down a topic of interest in one of these time slots. (Of course, nothing holds you back to already think about or even prepare a topic you would like to see discussed). If we have more topics than time slots we will either open an extra breakout room, or simply vote on which topics we want to cover. After that we breakout in 30 minute sessions to discuss the top-voted topics. One person, per group, is asked to present what was discussed and possibly some answers, best practices or results. We repeat the breakout / plenary presentation bit two or three times.</p> <p><b>(Tentative) schedule</b></p> <p>16:30 Walk-in</p> <p>17:00 Opening and welcome</p> <p>17:15 Start Open Space</p> <p>17:30 First Breakout Round</p> <p>18:15 Dinner</p> <p>19:00 Second Breakout Round</p> <p>19:45 Break</p> <p>20:00 Third Breakout Round</p> <p>20:45 Drinks and time to meet.</p> <p><b>This is what people said about our last Open Space meetup in 2012</b></p> <p>\"<i>Excellent setting.

If you are lacking Java or general OO programming skills this workshop will be a bit of a challenge.

By charging money we want to make sure people who are attending are serious about learning how to create better quality Android apps. </p> <p><b>Note: Attending this course does not directly result in official Udacity certification!</b> If you want to pass the official Android Fundamentals certification you normally must buy a subscription. However, free certification for some attendees is possible, pending your course performance.

It is very open, highly active and interactive. Always aiming to discuss, distill and find solutions for the most interesting topics, latest information and challenges which you are facing every day, in your role as Android professional. Seats are limited, so join sooner rather than later!</p> <p><b>Skills in our group...</b></p> <p>All kind of roles and skills are represented in our group. From entrepreneurs to testers, graphics designers to architects and of course a fair amount of developers. We need each other to build better apps and this need is clearer than ever in our every day challenge to meet the deadline on some Android project and creating awesome user experiences while we are at it.</p> <p><b>Process</b></p> <p>We open the doors around 4:30pm and aim to start at 5:00pm with the opening, welcome, general announcement. After that we will explain the chosen Open Space process:</p> <p>\u2022 We will have a large board with empty time slots.<br/>\u2022 Everybody will have a chance to write down a topic of interest in one of these time slots. (Of course, nothing holds you back to already think about or even prepare a topic you would like to see discussed!)<br/>\u2022 If we have more topics than time slots we will either open an extra breakout room, or simply vote on which topics we want to cover.<br/>\u2022 After that, we breakout in 30 minute sessions to discuss the top-voted topics in which. One person, per group, is asked to present what was discussed and possibly some answers, best practices or results. We repeat the breakout / plenary presentation bit two or three times.</p> <p><b>(Tentative) schedule</b></p> <p>16:30 Walk-in</p> <p>17:00 Opening and welcome</p> <p>17:15 Start Open Space</p> <p>17:30 First Breakout Round</p> <p>18:15 Dinner</p> <p>19:00 Second Breakout Round</p> <p>19:45 Break</p> <p>20:00 Third Breakout Round</p> <p>20:45 Drinks and time to meet.</p> <p><b>This is what people said about Dutch Android Open Space 2012</b></p> <p><i>\"Excellent setting.

Why was it developed, what makes it different compared to other build tools? We are going to learn about the basic principles of Gradle and how Gradle tries to be a great build tool. We look at core concepts of Gradle with small examples.</p> <p>Mr. Haki has written a couple of <a href=\"http://mrhaki.com/books.html\">books</a> on Gradle and also writes regularly about Groovy, Grails and Gradle on his <a href=\"http://mrhaki.com\">blog</a>.</p> <p><b>19:30</b> Coffee Break</p> <p><b>19:45 <i>\"Extending Gradle\u2026 Development. Distribution. Rock!\"</i>  (Vitalik Zasadnyy)</b><br/>Have you ever had a task to automate builds with Gradle? When working on a big project build scripts can become messy very easy. Luckily for us, Gradle makes it easy to decouple build logic from the configuration. During the talk, we'll talk about extending gradle, developing and publishing plugins and check what Gradle APIs available for that. This presentation will be interesting for developers who want to dig deeper into Gradle, rather than just using the Android plugin, as well as build masters that author build logic on a regular basis and want to learn best practices for organizing build code, plugin development and writing custom extensions for Gradle.</p> <p><b>20:30</b> Drinks &amp; snacks</p> <p><b>21:00</b> Doors closed</p> <p>We're co-organizing this meetup with the brand new <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Gradle-Meetup/\">Gradle-Meetup</a> group.

De ingang vind je twee deuren naar links van de ingang van Wieden+Kennedy.</p> <p><b>Let op:</b> we hebben een intercom aan de rechterkant van onze voordeur. Je kunt daar aanbellen, waarna we de deur op afstand voor je kunnen openen.Hetzelfde voor de glazen deur die je in de hal vindt. Ons kantoor bevindt zich op de vierde verdieping, aan de linkerkant als je de lift uitkomt.Voor onze exacte locatie en/of een persoonlijke routebeschrijving, zie <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/M2Mobi/@52.371446,4.886486,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x47c609c393c55a41:0x98ff1512b08ae50a\">Google Maps</a> </p> <p><b>Vervoer</b></p> <p>De makkelijkste manier om ons kantoor te bereiken is op de fiets of met openbaar vervoer. Voor onze deur vind je verschillende fiets-parkeerplaatsen. Daarnaast hebben we op drie minuten lopen tramhalte \u201cWestermarkt\u201d, waar de tramlijnen 13, 14 en 17 stoppen. Ook de tramhalte \u201cDam\u201d is slechts vijf minuten te voet, waar tram 1, 2 en 5 stoppen.</p> <p>Het centrum van Amsterdam kan per auto soms lastig te bereiken zijn. Hetzelfde geldt voor het vinden van een parkeerplaats. Er zijn bij ons voor de deur de nodige parkeerplaatsen, maar die zijn zeer gewild en dus bezet. Wil je geen risico lopen op vertraging en eindeloos ronddwalen, dan raden we je aan te parkeren in de Q-Park (\u2018Europarking\u2019) op de Marnixstraat 250. Vanaf de parkeergarage is het zo\u2019n tien minuten naar ons kantoor lopen. Geef het door aan je contactpersoon bij M2mobi als je hier je auto hebt staan.</p> <p>Een alternatief is Q-Park (\u2018De Bijenkorf\u2019) op het Beursplein 15 of op de Elandsgracht aan de straat.

Or how they\u2019ve set their app up? On this evening we\u2019ll cover both. We\u2019ll have 3 sessions about architectures and an hour of open mic stage where everyone can share their architecture and tools.</p> <p><b>Sessions </b><br/><b> Remco Mokveld, Android developer @ The Capitals <br/></b><i>Remco will present a newapproach to application architecture which is much more heavily focussed on the features of an app rather than how those are implemented. Remco will describe the benefits of this approach compared to what we previously did and give a short example of how he implemented this.</i></p> <p><b>Jordy Langen, Team Lead Mobile development @ Mediaan </b><br/><i>Working with a relatively new technology means there is always much to be gained and improved. Now that we fixed our problems with views, networking and asynchronous processing it\u2019s time to put that all together and build an architecture on top of this.</i></p> <p><i>There is the MVP and although even Google is using it nowadays, it\u2019s not perfect. Jordy will talk about how they implemented MVP in their latest apps, which problems they faced and how they worked around them. Jordy thinks Model View Intent is a natural evolution of MVP and it might just be the next best thing.</i></p> <p><b>Ronald Warners, Chapter Lead Android @ ING </b><br/><i>The ING Mobile Banking app had its 5th birthday. Ronald will tell us about what happened when developing the Mobile Banking app. Which design and architectural decisions were made in the past and which ones are being made now?</i></p> <p><b>Serj Lotutovici, Senior Android Developer @ Travelbird</b><br/><i>A good architecture is more than just a fancy structure of your project, or trendy thing that everyone has to follow. With so many great examples out there on how to build an MVP or MVI app, one might think that the job is done and there is nothing left to discover or create. But one burden of any architecture is that it has to scale with Android, and that is not an easy task.</i></p> <p><i>In this small session we are going to dive deep into the challenges that one faces when adopting an architecture on an example of a complex RecyclerView that relies on an RxMVI approach.</i></p> <p><b>Hugo Visser, Android Developer @ Little Robots</b><br/><i>A quick tour of the new architecture component libraries, we're we'll look at what these components are and what they aim to solve</i></p> <p><b>Program</b><br/>17:15 <i>Doors open</i> <br/>17:30 <i>Dinner</i> <br/>18:30 <i>Opening</i> <br/>18:45 Remco Mokveld <br/>19:10 Jordy Langen <br/>19:35 Ronald Warners <br/>19:55 <i>Break</i> <br/>20:10 Serj Lotutovici<br/>20:35 Hugo Visser <br/>21:00 <i>Drinks<br/>21:30 Lights out</i></p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1497559184000,"duration":16200000,"id":"240823615","name":"Google I/O Extended Extended BBQ","rsvp_limit":50,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1499353200000,"local_date":"2017-07-06","local_time":"17:00","updated":1499534123000,"utc_offset":7200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":44,"venue":{"id":20918462,"name":"Pixplicity","lat":52.068660736083984,"lon":5.110750198364258,"repinned":false,"address_1":"Kanaalweg 14","city":"Utrecht","country":"nl","localized_country_name":"Netherlands"},"group":{"created":1319226806000,"name":"The Dutch Android User Group","id":2687312,"join_mode":"open","lat":52.099998474121094,"lon":5.110000133514404,"urlname":"dutch-aug","who":"Daugians","localized_location":"Utrecht, Netherlands","state":"","country":"nl","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Amsterdam"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/dutch-aug/events/240823615/","description":"<p><img src=\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/a/1/f/600_461958975.jpeg\" /></p> <p>Google I/O left us with many new things to learn.

At this year\u2019s Google I/O Kotlin was announced as a fully supported language for developing Android apps.</p> <p>So let\u2019s dig in! Let\u2019s see what we can do with Kotlin.</p> <p>Join us for talks about Kotlin in general and how we can use it for developing apps.</p> <p><b>Rene de Groot - Everyday Kotlin</b><br/><i> With domain languages, lamda's. coroutines, tail recursions, operator overloading  and (weird) JVM-annotations Kotlin might seem overwhelming. So lets take a look at everyday Android development and how Kotlin helps you there. We take a look on how your knowledge of Java and Java best practises puts in an advantage when programming in Kotlin.</i></p> <p><b>Serj Lotutovici - Getting Schwifty: Functional Programming with Kotlin</b><br/><i> Writing good software is hard, writing bug free software is next to impossible, but that doesn\u2019t mean that we should never tend to that mythical abstract of `fun` and sustainable code. Add multithreading, state management and a pile of interconnected components to your system and you\u2019ll find that functional programming is your best bet against the vicious spaghetti monster. So, let\u2019s take off\u2026 our hats, and get schwifty with Kotlin.</i></p> <p><b>Simon Vergauwen - Sealing in the flavor with Kotlin</b><br/><i>Kotlin brings sealed classes and functional programming paradigms to the table. A type safe design can do miracles for your codebase so let's take a look how we can model runtime errors in our type system and what advantages FP concepts offer.</i></p> <p><b>Program</b> <br/>17:00 <i>Doors open</i> <br/>17:30 <i>Dinner</i> <br/>18:15 <i>Opening</i> <br/>18:30 Rene de Groot <br/>19:15 Simon Vergauwen  <br/>20:00 <i>Break</i> <br/>20:15 Serj Lotutovici <br/>21:00 <i>Drinks</i> <br/><i>21:45 Lights out</i></p> <p><i><br/></i></p> <p><b>Getting there</b><br/>There will be parking spots available at Sogeti.
