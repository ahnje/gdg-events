In particular, we need help conducting some of the following activities:</p> <p>1) Code Labs </p> <p>This is basically a presentation where you deliver a walkthrough of a technology that you're very familiar with, and can speak about / live code for a segment of time. We can even pair you with someone else and divide and conquer individual pieces of related technologies. Google has done a really good job of feeding me some fantastic content for this program, including things like \"Polymer\", which I'm going to say has a chance of revolutionizing web development.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pYGVB2lG9w\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pYGVB2lG9w</a></p> <p>I can provide you with plenty of other jaw dropping techs to demo :). </p> <p>2) Code Reviews </p> <p>This is a collaborative mentoring session where we will collect a bunch of talented developers, architects and other technologists to provide assistance to anyone who's stuck on a particular project and wants some help. </p> <p>3) Google tech demos </p> <p>This is fun. I'll give you some really good content courtesy of the GDG network, and you will get to demo it. For one, we will run an entire \"Android Wear\" event. There are nice slide decks provided by Google, you'll simply need to gain some familiarity with them, and run through it. One great thing is that we've also been given clearance to give away 2-3 Android Wear devices for free. Pretty cool especially considering it hasn't hit the market yet. </p> <p>4) Google tech trivia </p> <p>I was kinda thinking of handling this one myself, but I think that's ambitious. I'm sure I'll need tons of help on it. Pretty self explanatory, and fun. </p> <p>Anyway, I'd love to meet everyone who I haven't previously met, and would like to get many of you involved in a really fun project that could change the landscape of tech in the Garden State!

Challenge, at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center in New York.  </p> <p>Dr. Welty's principal area of research is the role of semantic technology in deep analytic problems such as natural language processing.  He led three technical teams in IBM's Watson project: structured knowledge exploitation, rapid domain adaptation, and crowd sourcing. </p> <p>In addition to numerous scientific achievements, Dr. Welty has played an active role in transferring research into practice through web standards, open software development, and the meetup community.</p> <p>At WWW 2011, soon after the notable performance of IBM's Watson on Jeopardy,  Dr. Welty laid out the skeleton of a new computing paradigm, which IBM has since been dubbed \"Cognitive Computing\".  Over the three years since then, cognitive computing is proving to be a radical shift in software and information technology that disrupts previously understood terms like \"performance\", \"feature\", \"debugging\", and even \"truth\".  </p> <p><i><b>In this talk, Dr. Welty will give a personal perspective on how cognitive computing has progressed and is re-shaping the software solution business and ecosystem, as well as our very expectations of what computers are capable of.</b></i></p> <p><b><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lI-M7O_bRNg\">See Chris and the rest of the team at IBM talking about Watson</a></b> in a behind- the-scenes video from IBM in 2011 documenting Watson's performance on Jeopardy against grand champions Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter. </p> <p>We're also extremely excited to be joined by <b>Todd Carter,</b> Founder/ CEO of <a href=\"http://www.tagasauris.com/\">Tagasauris</a> Inc.</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/b/4/600_431402740.jpeg\" /></p> <p>Tagasauris is an intelligent data platform for visual media that combines human assisted computing with semantic Web technologies to create networked, relationship-aware image and video objects.

They're running an event entitled \"Grokking Realm - A New Mobile Database.\" They'll be hosted by Audible in their downtown Newark office. The talk will be given by Donn Felker, a Google Developer Expert on Android.</p> <p>Abstract: Learn about the new mobile database on the block, Realm. With Realm you work with regular Java objects - not SQL, cursors or object mappers. These same Java objects are native to Realm. Learn how to use Realm and its reactive features to build apps faster and more efficiently without having to write a line of SQL. You'll leave with a firm understanding of how to install, setup, store and retrieve data with a Realm database. When you get back to the office you can use Realm to help you focus on solving a business problem instead of worrying about how to get your data in and out of a database.</p> <p>Pizza and beer will be provided by Audible!</p> <p>Audible Inc.<br/>1 Washington Place, Newark, NJ, 15th Floor (map)</p> <p>How to get here:<br/>1.
