In our gathering, we aim to get to know each other while sharing our resources and expectations in order to form a roadmap moving forward.

Imagine an application that has a web, mobile and watch UI. They all offer different functionality and therefore require access to different information and functions. A default solution in such a situation would be to try to build a generic backend that can be used by all clients. But trying to build a one size fits all solution often backfires and raises multiple questions, e.g.:<br/>- Who owns the API and how to implement changes required by different UI teams?<br/>- What interface to use?<br/>- What if two clients need the same data in different shapes?<br/>- How to optimize the APIs for different clients?<br/>- What to do when the API gets too large?<br/>Having a generic backend for all UI‚Äôs leads to mediocre performance, degraded user experience as well as additional communication overheads for the development teams. Seeing how this approach doesn‚Äôt work we can go in another direction: build different API services for different clients. Thus enter Sam Newman‚Äôs Backend For Frontend pattern that inroduces the idea of having a separate backend for each type of UI in your application. Add the newly popular GraphQL API on on top, and you now have the means to take this pattern to a whole new level. During this talk we will explore how using the BFF pattern and GraphQL can help us address the quetions we‚Äôve listed before and improve our overall application architecture.</p> <p>Pavels Jelisejevs. Full-stack developer and architect.
