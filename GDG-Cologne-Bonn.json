In our gathering, we aim to get to know each other while sharing our resources and expectations in order to form a roadmap moving forward. This will not only help us with prioritizing the most help needed areas but also with identifying the core team and potential Women Techmakers Ambassadors, for which both women and men can apply, to take the lead on several initiatives.</p> <p>We will also provide insights into how and why Google is supporting such a network across the world while presenting some key dates and international events that take place every year.</p> <p>Regardless of your skill level or experience, it's a fun and open environment, so we'd love to have you come along!</p> <p>Last but not least, there will be catering and networking opportunities. Let's spread the word and bring the change-makers in the Cologne/Bonn region together.</p> <p>Looking forward to it!</p> <p>Thank you,</p> <p>Nihal</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false}],"upcoming":[],"organizers":[{"id":171061012,"name":"Pascal W.","bio":"Flutter Google Developer Expert","status":"active","joined":1410782132000,"city":"Köln","country":"de","localized_country_name":"Germany","lat":50.95,"lon":6.97,"photo":{"id":284814381,"highres_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/d/4/6/d/highres_284814381.jpeg","photo_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/d/4/6/d/member_284814381.jpeg","thumb_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/d/4/6/d/thumb_284814381.jpeg","type":"member","base_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com"},"group_profile":{"status":"active","visited":1571402726000,"created":1560179133000,"updated":1568055630000,"role":"coorganizer","group":{"id":30659474,"urlname":"GDG-Cologne-Bonn","name":"GDG Cologne/Bonn","status":"active","who":"Members","members":167,"join_mode":"open","localized_location":"Cologne, Germany","group_photo":{"id":476884396,"highres_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/2/c/highres_476884396.jpeg","photo_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/2/c/600_476884396.jpeg","thumb_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/2/c/thumb_476884396.jpeg","type":"event","base_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com"}},"answers":[{"question_id":8864766,"question":"What are your expectations by joining GDG Cologne-Bonn?"},{"question_id":8864773,"question":"Could you please name the best tech related book you ever read?"}],"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Cologne-Bonn/members/171061012/"},"is_pro_admin":false},{"id":261306506,"name":"Nihal Y.","status":"active","joined":1534534288000,"city":"Cologne","country":"de","localized_country_name":"Germany","lat":50.94,"lon":6.96,"photo":{"id":279845014,"highres_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/1/3/9/6/highres_279845014.jpeg","photo_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/1/3/9/6/member_279845014.jpeg","thumb_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/1/3/9/6/thumb_279845014.jpeg","type":"member","base_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com"},"group_profile":{"status":"active","visited":1573719422000,"created":1544105491000,"updated":1544107528000,"role":"organizer","group":{"id":30659474,"urlname":"GDG-Cologne-Bonn","name":"GDG Cologne/Bonn","status":"active","who":"Members","members":167,"join_mode":"open","localized_location":"Cologne, Germany","group_photo":{"id":476884396,"highres_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/2/c/highres_476884396.jpeg","photo_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/2/c/600_476884396.jpeg","thumb_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/2/c/thumb_476884396.jpeg","type":"event","base_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com"}},"answers":[{"question_id":8864766,"question":"What are your expectations by joining GDG Cologne-Bonn?"},{"question_id":8864773,"question":"Could you please name the best tech related book you ever read?"}],"intro":"Community Builder / Lean In Leader / Industrial Engineer / Technology Enthusiast","link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Cologne-Bonn/members/261306506/"},"is_pro_admin":false}]}
