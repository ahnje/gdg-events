The presentation will focus on the differences in building the UI and the learning curve for each platform. Silouanos will then demonstrate good and bad practices often followed in each platform.</p> <p>In the second part of this presentation, Silouanos will talk about how a programmer can utilise the new Android's programming language, Kotlin, to build shared code for the two platforms.</p> <p>18:00 Doors Open<br/>18:30 Talk starts<br/>19:30 Meet &amp; Greet</p> <p>p.s.

Furthermore, it provides concise and easy-to-use defaults, that have been optimised in terms of security and performance.

Furthermore, it provides concise and easy-to-use defaults, that have been optimised in terms of security and performance.

A subject that is very much of interest to anyone and everyone amidst the coronavirus pandemic. A great opportunity for everyone to think of and implement alternative ways of teaching.</p> <p>Due to the lockdown measures, education systems around the world were forced into remote teaching and learning in order to ensure the continuation of educating our youth. Some schools were better prepared than others with the platforms already in place. Other schools had to address getting their teachers and students the basics before they could even consider operating in this way. No matter what level of readiness, school administrations, teachers, students and parents entered the virtual classroom without fully knowing what to expect. Christina Shailas, Educational Technologist at The Heritage Private School in Limassol, has joined us to share her experiences throughout this journey so far.</p> <p>A few words about Christina Shailas<br/>Christina Shailas is a first-generation Cypriot and Constantinople-Greek, born and raised in New York York City. Christina completed her undergraduate degree at New York University where she majored in Mathematics and Political Science. She went on to Columbia University to complete her Masters degree in Mathematics Education. Christina worked as a Mathematics Teacher and Technology Integrationist at Convent of the Sacred Heart, a prestigious independent school in Upper East Side, Manhattan. She implemented a school-wide paperless classroom through a 1-1 iPad program and worked closely with faculty/students to integrate technology into classroom organization, instruction and projects. In addition, Christina developed a makers lab and curriculum where students worked with 3D printers, robotics, circuitry, programming and virtual reality. Extremely passionate about designing curricula that fosters a love for lifelong learning, Christina integrated technology into design-thinking activities as a way to encourage problem solving, critical thinking and resilience in her students. She has immense knowledge in Google for Education and Microsoft Education, as well as experience in onboarding schools to these platforms. Last year, Christina joined The Heritage Private School in Limassol, Cyprus with the purpose of continuing her roles as a technology integrationist and assisting to develop the school's educational technology program. Christina also serves as the Cyprus Liaison to the Cyprus-U.S. Chamber of Commerce.</p> <p>The link of the session will be provided on the day of the event.</p> <p>PS: If you have any questions, feel
