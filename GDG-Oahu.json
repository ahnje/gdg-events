Learn from experts and access free hands-on labs during this online Cloud Study Jam. In this session, we'll work through a lab in the Google Cloud Run Serverless Workshop. Googlers will be on stand-by to answer your questions about the labs and discuss other serverless technology solutions.</p> <p>Locally, weʻll have a #cloudjam slack channel open for discussion before, during, and after the event! After the session, keep the learning going. Chat online, finish up the quest, earn a badge, and become eligible for extended access to QwikLabs and other Google Cloud learning tools. If there is enough interest, we will plan future in-person, on-island Cloud Study Jams, supported by Google!</p> <p>If you can't make the live training but are still interested, sign up anyway! You can still participate with us after the fact, and we'll provide support during the 2 weeks following the event to help everyone complete the quest.</p> <p>SEPARATE REGISTRATION REQUIRED!
