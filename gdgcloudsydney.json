You can increase your time-to-market and improve data scientist productivity by simplifying the steps needed from exploring your data to deploying a production-ready model. Using Cloud Datalab ML Workbench and ML Engine, we will show how you can start with sampled data for quick experiments and then scale up to 1000s of machines with a simple additional flag to cover large datasets. We will also cover model evaluation and explanation of predicted results to understand how the model is performing.</p> <p>Date: Friday 3rd November<br/>Location: Servian, Level 36, 60 Margaret Street, Sydney, NSW, 2000<br/>Time: 5.30pm - 6.30pm<br/>Pizza, beer and soft drinks provided :)</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1509415591000,"duration":5400000,"id":"244674310","name":"Code night: Serverless Java/React on App Engine","rsvp_limit":100,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1511245800000,"local_date":"2017-11-21","local_time":"17:30","rsvp_close_offset":"PT24H","updated":1511294083000,"utc_offset":39600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":45,"group":{"created":1502232249000,"name":"GDG Cloud - Sydney","id":25415736,"join_mode":"open","lat":-33.869998931884766,"lon":151.2100067138672,"urlname":"gdgcloudsydney","who":"Members","localized_location":"Sydney, Australia","state":"","country":"au","region":"en_US","timezone":"Australia/Sydney"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdgcloudsydney/events/244674310/","description":"<p>This is a hands-on code camp with free booze and food.

Our first version makes use of Google’s Cloud Vision API. We'll discuss how to use the Cloud Vision API in your applications, what it is good at, what it is not.</p> <p>We will then look at using transfer learning to improve our system’s ability to recognise Ad Breaches. I will look at how we can use the popular Tensorflow library to build our own image recognition model. Tensorflow comes with several pre-trained models for image recognition - using these I will show you how to build your own specialised image recognition models in a fraction of the time, and with a fraction of the input data, by re-using existing pre-trained layers from the best models out there.</p> <p>Speaker Bio:<br/>Gareth Jones is a Melbourne based consultant at Shine Solutions.

The vast majority of organisations are looking to move to the Cloud. A key part of this strategy involves modernising on premise and reducing risk by taking a multi-cloud approach. Anthos enables the hybrid and multi-cloud journeys whilst providing a single pane of glass to manage these environments. In this talk, you'll learn about the components that make up Anthos and how they apply to your organisation. The talk will also cover the tools you need to build &amp; operate your environment including GKE on-prem, Istio, Anthos Config Management, Cloud Run, Migrate for Anthos and more.</p> <p><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/anthos/\" class=\"linkified\">https://cloud.google.com/anthos/</a></p> <p>Meetup agenda;<br/>6.30-7pm - Event start.

Geshan Manandhar and Dheerendra Nath will be taking us through the following topics;</p> <p>Presentation 1;<br/>From 0 to Working Serverless url for a Containerised App with Google Cloud Run<br/>(Geshan Manandhar - Senior Software Engineer @ The Iconic)</p> <p>Ever wondered if you could run your web application container on a serverless platform? Wait no further with the recent Google Cloud Run release it is already possible. You can get from 0 to a working serverless URL for a containerized app in no time. Till now there was nothing that married the goodness of serverless with container's ease. Cloud Run also makes deploying new versions very easy with its web interface. This talk will be a run-through of deploying and running a simple nodejs app on Google Cloud Run in a matter of minutes.</p> <p>Presentation 2;<br/>Modern Data Warehouse Design on Google Cloud<br/>(Dheerendra Nath - Senior Engineer @ Shine Solutions)</p> <p>You may already familiar with the capabilities of BigQuery and Dataflow and use them to ingest data and do big data processing. However, not many developers are truly familiar with how to implement the critical capabilities of a data warehouse - segmentation of data into daily partitions, maintaining partition isolation, using the correct partition in views across the board, how to implement one-click rollback or roll-forward so that no views need to be redeployed, how to design automation with intermediate results (e.g. asynchronously rolling the date forward and computing intermediate results every interval), etc.</p> <p>Any GCP developer that intends to build a modern, scalable data lake with GCP will need to have these tricks up their sleeve.</p> <p>Look forward to seeing you all there.</p> ","how_to_find_us":"Come to  Australia Square, Level 46, 264 George St, Sydney NSW 2000. \n(New offices for Servian - Google Cloud Partner sponsoring this event).","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1578982892000,"duration":5400000,"id":"267899575","name":"Kickoff 2020: Predicting cricket and Serverless demos by Googler Grant Timmerman","rsvp_limit":90,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1581490800000,"local_date":"2020-02-12","local_time":"18:00","updated":1581497911000,"utc_offset":39600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":81,"venue":{"id":26811269,"name":"Kasna Offices (Mantel Group)","lat":-33.866275787353516,"lon":151.2071075439453,"repinned":true,"address_1":"Level 7","address_2":"309 George Street","city":"Sydney","country":"au","localized_country_name":"Australia"},"group":{"created":1502232249000,"name":"GDG Cloud - Sydney","id":25415736,"join_mode":"open","lat":-33.869998931884766,"lon":151.2100067138672,"urlname":"gdgcloudsydney","who":"Members","localized_location":"Sydney, Australia","state":"","country":"au","region":"en_US","timezone":"Australia/Sydney"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdgcloudsydney/events/267899575/","description":"<p>We're kicking off 2020 with these 2 highly interesting talks!
