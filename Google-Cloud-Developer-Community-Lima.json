As a long-time Java and C# developer, he likes to compare the two ecosystems. Prior to Google, he worked at Microsoft, Skype, Adobe, EMC, and Nokia building apps and services on various web, mobile and cloud platforms. Originally from the island of Cyprus, he currently lives in Greenwich of London, not too far away from the prime meridian.</p> <p>He will present the talk: \"Google Assistant powered by Containers, Machine Learning and .NET on Google Cloud\"</p> <p>What does it take to connect Google Assistant to the cloud? Surprisingly, not much! In this talk, we will create a Dialogflow app to get Google Assistant to talk to a container managed by Kubernetes/App Engine. In the container, we’ll use some of the Machine Learning APIs and BigQuery and see how they can elevate our Google Assistant app to the next level. We will also integrate with Stackdriver and see how you can get more insights about your app with HTTP tracing and live debugging features of Stackdriver.</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1551793270000,"duration":7200000,"id":"259499915","name":"Meetup #1","rsvp_limit":40,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1552435200000,"local_date":"2019-03-12","local_time":"19:00","updated":1552447976000,"utc_offset":-18000000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":40,"venue":{"id":26136948,"name":"La Victoria Lab","lat":-12.088549613952637,"lon":-77.01920318603516,"repinned":false,"address_1":"Manuel Arrisueño 697","city":"La Victoria","country":"pe","localized_country_name":"Peru"},"group":{"created":1523294536000,"name":"Google Cloud Developer Community Lima","id":28102440,"join_mode":"open","lat":-12.069999694824219,"lon":-77.05000305175781,"urlname":"Google-Cloud-Developer-Community-Lima","who":"Miembros","localized_location":"Lima, Peru","state":"","country":"pe","region":"en_US","timezone":"America/Lima"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/Google-Cloud-Developer-Community-Lima/events/259499915/","description":"<p>Tenemos nuestro primer Meetup del año!
