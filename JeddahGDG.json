Boosting and connecting communities everywhere to organize their own SWAI and empower their ecosystems to tackle problems using AI.</p> <p>Over the same 2 weekends, over 15 cities will organize a SWAI in their local community. Everyone will be connected throughout the world, with Global Mentors, facilitators &amp; organizers.</p> <p>In just 54 hours, participants will form teams, brainstorm, design a product, validate their business idea and pitch in front of experienced judges on Saturday evening. Throughout the weekend, there will be highs and lows, frustrations and moments of triumph, but some people will meet their co-founder at the event, and some teams will even move on to start a company after the event. Win or lose, we are certain that new lessons will be learned, ideas will be tested, limits will be pushed and lives will be changed forever.</p> <p>To spice things up, we will be having a few special activities: party and warm up games on Thursday night to break the ice and form your teams!! On Friday, we will be inviting awesome mentors and guests down to interact with the teams so please seek their advice and opinions! In the true spirit of Startup Weekend, we will be bringing in local startups, budding founders and cool companies to sponsor, showcase and network with you! Remember, Startup Weekend is a time for experiential learning, networking and building your personal brand!</p> <p>It is for everyone, whether you are working corporate, building your own startup, having a career as a professional clown, a mechanic, a designer, coder or student, everyone can contribute in their own way. We are open to teams forming before the event, but we strongly recommend you to form your team on Friday night and work on an idea then. Startup Weekend is designed to embrace diversity, creating a conducive environment for anyone to turn their concepts into companies!
