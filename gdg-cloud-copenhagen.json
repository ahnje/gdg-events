But exposing your application to the big and wild internet can be difficult. In the presentation we go through three levels of API surface maturity and sophistication. We start with a very basic solution and move to sophisticated handling of authentication, monitoring, routing and different levels of user tiers for monetization. We will see how this is done by rolling our own security before moving on to Google Endpoints and finally going all-in with Apigee.</p> <p>Title: Why serverless never really worked for me until now!<br/>Speaker: Kevin Simper<br/>Description: In this presentation I want to talk about how I have tried serverless many times but always had issues. I could see the potential but it was always difficult to see it end to end, and when you are busy to often end up defaulting to what you already know.

It is a super interesting product that allows you to run any Docker container and you only pay for what you use! Meaning this is the perfect product for developers that are making new product, startups or even for side-projects!</p> <p>Sign up here: <a href=\"https://ti.to/gdg-cloud-copenhagen/serverless-workshop-with-cloud-run-and-cloud-build\" class=\"linkified\">https://ti.to/gdg-cloud-copenhagen/serverless-workshop-with-cloud-run-and-cloud-build</a></p> <p>In this workshop we will start from scratch, build a simple application and then launch it on Cloud Run. Afterwards will we try to use Google Cloud - Cloud Build to build our app each time we make a commit. This would be continuous integration as each time we make a chance we ensure that everything is building and works. Lastly we will connect Cloud Build to Cloud Run so that each time we commit it will automatically deploy our latest chances. This is incredible powerful as we are able to deploy something with very little overhead and pay nearly nothing for something high value, keeping backend online at all times!</p> <p>This workshop is non-profit and it costs 50 kroners to cover renting the room and for the drinks and food. All details will publish like this last workshop <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uEPctiqXYL89QBnE9Ja6H5kHKuFkxuPd4N9E78UBfQ8/edit#gid=0\" class=\"linkified\">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uEPctiqXYL89QBnE9Ja6H5kHKuFkxuPd4N9E78UBfQ8/edit#gid=0</a></p> <p>Schedule:<br/>17:00 Doors Open<br/>17:30 Welcome<br/>17:40 What is serverless and Cloud Run?<br/>18:00 Exercises with Cloud Run<br/>18:30 Sandwiches and drinks<br/>18:50 Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment with Cloud Build<br/>19:10 Exercises with Cloud Build<br/>20:30 Follow up talk and networking!</p> <p>Before the workshop it would be best if you signed up for Google Cloud. It is free and will not cost you anything monthly, but it takes a few minutes as you have to confirm your mobile number.</p> <p>Who is behind and why?<br/>My name is Kevin, I like organizing meetups and workshops and teaching. I think that Cloud Run and Cloud Build are such cool tools for any developers that I think more people will benefit of knowing them. I think that the best way to learn is hands-on and having somebody to help just for a second over the shoulder when something doesnât work is the best. Also being productive and feeling productive is one thing that makes me very happy each day and those tools contribute to that ð</p> <p>Where can I read more about Cloud Run?<br/>Yes, you can read more about Cloud Run here <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/run/\" class=\"linkified\">https://cloud.google.com/run/</a> Our community friend Martin Omander has also made this cool series on youtube about Serverless Toolbox, they are pretty funny <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIivdWyY5sqKiWvnaA5A8F3UQ0Xu5i49U\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIivdWyY5sqKiWvnaA5A8F3UQ0Xu5i49U</a><br/>I also have two talks about serverless and cloud run that shows a bit what we are going to go through:<br/>How Cloud Run is the final destination in my Cloud Native journey <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oY9Mv9PHu7U\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oY9Mv9PHu7U</a><br/>Why serverless never really worked for me until now! <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viGxI22fOuo\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viGxI22fOuo</a></p> <p>Best regards Kevin</p> <p>If you have any questions please reach out to me either here or on mail.

In this presentation you will see how we started our work in one of the teams. It goes into how (and why) we early started with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform, and Continuous Integration with Cloud Build. You will also hear some ways how to select in what order to introduce different DevOps practices and tools.</p> <p>Cloud Build &amp; Triggers-as-code â Mads SÃ¸rensen Ãlsgaard</p> <p>This talk will go over how Cloud Build can be used for automating deployment of large applications on GCP and includes tips for building advanced pipelines and examples for how to manage all of Cloud Build as code in git.</p> <p>Google Deployment Manager: The good, the bad and the ugly - Casper Fabricius</p> <p>Infrastructure as code is the new black, and Google's product for IaC is called Deployment Manager. When Driversnote moved to Google Cloud in the beginning of 2019, we decided to go with Deployment Manager, and that proved to be a mixed bag of good, bad and ugly experiences. This talk will cover them all, and help you decide if Deployment Manager may be right for your IaC needs.</p> <p>---</p> <p>What is GDG Cloud Copenhagen?<br/>It is a meetup group that is organized by the community and supported by Google sometimes with resources.
