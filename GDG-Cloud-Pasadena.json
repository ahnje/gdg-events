Depending on how long that takes, the extra topic we might explore (but probably won't want to overwhelm people with) is setting up SFTP file transfers to the server.</p> <p>Our measurement of having a successful talk will be to see if you've spun up your own machines afterwards. :)</p> <p>There will be 3 parts to the session:<br/>- mingle<br/>- presentation<br/>- questions</p> <p>Weâ€™ll also have a brief introduction of our operational principles as a GDG meetup.</p> <p>We hope to see you there!
