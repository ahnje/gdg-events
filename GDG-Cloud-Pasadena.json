Depending on how long that takes, the extra topic we might explore (but probably won't want to overwhelm people with) is setting up SFTP file transfers to the server.</p> <p>Our measurement of having a successful talk will be to see if you've spun up your own machines afterwards. :)</p> <p>There will be 3 parts to the session:<br/>- mingle<br/>- presentation<br/>- questions</p> <p>We’ll also have a brief introduction of our operational principles as a GDG meetup.</p> <p>We hope to see you there! Parking/Transit details below:<br/>----------</p> <p>Parking</p> <p>The DesignLab is at 30 E Del Mar Blvd, Pasadena, CA. You probably won't find street parking nearby, but please see this Google map (<a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=z336KXOi6I8Q.kWuP10Ksdh4Y\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=z336KXOi6I8Q.kWuP10Ksdh4Y</a>) showing the DesignLab location and nearby parking structures.</p> <p>-----------</p> <p>Public Transportation</p> <p>Using the Metro Goldline trains is quick and easy. It takes about 20 mins from Union Station in downtown LA to Del Mar Station, which is less than 2 minutes walk from our front door. Trains run about every 10 mins during the day and 20 mins at night from 11pm-2am.</p> <p>There are also buses that serve Old Town Pasadena. The nearest intersection is FAIR OAKS/DEL MAR BLVD, PASADENA, CA 91105.
