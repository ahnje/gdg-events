Our plan is to organize a weekly or bi-weekly event in which we will collectively analyze the latest and seminal research papers in the field of AI. We will be covering anything from computer vision, natural language processing to deep reinforcement learning and Bayesian networks. These meetups are intended to be an open discussion of the selected paper, related research and relevant model coding.</p> <p>The first meeting will be focused on Neural Style Transfer based on the paper:</p> <p>A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.06576.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.06576.pdf</a>)</p> <p>Neural Style Transfer is a novel application that highlights a few fascinating properties of neural networks, as well as serving as an introduction to transfer learning and the building of custom models, which will build the foundation for the meetups to come.</p> <p>Please read the paper beforehand and try to code it up yourself. We will be covering the code in detail at the meetup. As such, we ask that everyone code in TensorFlow and/or Keras so we are all speaking the same language in our discussion.</p> <p>As this is the first meetup we'll be hosting, it will be a bit more guided than usual. The goal however is to create an interactive study group where we collectively choose the research papers that we'd like to dig into and share the lessons we learn from attempting to execute the architecture in our own applications.
