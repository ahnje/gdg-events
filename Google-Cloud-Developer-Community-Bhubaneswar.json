According to Gartner, India’s IT spending is projected to total $89.2 billion in 2019. The IT buying pattern in India signals the increased use of cloud services by organizations.” This has led to an increase in demand to learn about Google Cloud, Machine Learning and Kubernetes.<br/>To cater to this growing demand, in May 2018, we welcomed our first Google Cloud Developer Community (GCDC) in India, and now we are 11 communities strong - Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Bhubaneswar, Chennai, Coimbatore, Hyderabad, Indore, Kolkata, Mumbai, New Delhi, and Pune with more than 10000 members. These communities host frequent meetups to discuss topics like Kubernetes, Google App Engine, Data Science, Machine Learning on Google Cloud. These communities are growing rapidly in terms of membership and frequency of technical meet-ups.<br/>To provide developers an opportunity to stay ahead of the curve, we are happy to introduce Cloud Study Jams in India. Study Jams are community-run study groups for developers. This is a great opportunity to bring members of the community together to learn something in person. These trainings give developers a specific skill they can use for personal development or career advancement.</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1551175900000,"duration":5400000,"id":"259291633","name":"Tensorflow Dev Summit Viewing Party & Introduction to Cloud Dataflow","rsvp_limit":30,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1552127400000,"local_date":"2019-03-09","local_time":"16:00","updated":1552135920000,"utc_offset":19800000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":20,"venue":{"id":25270520,"name":"Conference Room (2nd Floor)","lat":20.299402236938477,"lon":85.83094787597656,"repinned":true,"address_1":"OCAC Tower, Acharya Vihar","city":"Bhubaneswar","country":"in","localized_country_name":"India"},"group":{"created":1529575810000,"name":"GDG Cloud Bhubaneswar","id":28908704,"join_mode":"open","lat":20.270000457763672,"lon":85.83999633789062,"urlname":"Google-Cloud-Developer-Community-Bhubaneswar","who":"Members","localized_location":"Bhubaneswar, India","state":"","country":"in","region":"en_US","timezone":"Asia/Calcutta"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/Google-Cloud-Developer-Community-Bhubaneswar/events/259291633/","description":"<p>After viewing the keynote of TF Dev Summit Keynote Address<br/>there will be a session to give and introduction to Dataflow (<a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/\" class=\"linkified\">https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/</a>) service of GCP using some live examples.</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1552419458000,"duration":7200000,"id":"259707587","name":"Tensorflow and Machine Learning Meetup","rsvp_limit":1,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1552908600000,"local_date":"2019-03-18","local_time":"17:00","updated":1552917436000,"utc_offset":19800000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":8,"venue":{"id":26242536,"name":"Idco Conference Hall","lat":20.30552101135254,"lon":85.8539810180664,"repinned":true,"address_1":" IDCO Conference Hall, Annex Building, IDCO Tower, Rupali Square Bhubaneswar","city":"Bhubaneswar","country":"in","localized_country_name":"India"},"group":{"created":1529575810000,"name":"GDG Cloud Bhubaneswar","id":28908704,"join_mode":"open","lat":20.270000457763672,"lon":85.83999633789062,"urlname":"Google-Cloud-Developer-Community-Bhubaneswar","who":"Members","localized_location":"Bhubaneswar, India","state":"","country":"in","region":"en_US","timezone":"Asia/Calcutta"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/Google-Cloud-Developer-Community-Bhubaneswar/events/259707587/","description":"<p>Invite only meetup for community members working on specific problems that uses Machine Learning as part of the solution.
