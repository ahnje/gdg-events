More importantly, especially in settings like healthcare, good UI/UX is what encourages patients to continue using the apps you make. In this presentation, I’ll provide a brief introduction into the basics of custom drawing on Android, and explain the most common operations available to you.</p> <p>About Mark:<br/><i>I’ve been in the IT field as both a developer and project manager for almost a decade, working on everything from mobile games to cell phone network billing software.

But in practice, regular programming and software architecture are not that different. ‘Architecture’ is just how you manage code for the long term.</p> <p>If you’re soon to lead a large Android project (or already are), I’ll present a few tips to help you create a project that survives scaling-up and its inevitable onslaught of feature requests. We’ll delve into S.O.L.I.D. principles and how they apply to Android, using a live code demo.</p> <p>Although some Android experience is useful for getting the most out of this talk, most of it is applicable to any programmer that wants to code at scale, in any language.</p> <p>◙ <b>Firebase Notifications, Eric Fung</b></p> <p>With only a minimum of coding, Firebase provides your Android app with simple push notifications and collects analytics to measure user engagement. However, if you need to customize the notifications or their behaviour, you need to implement everything yourself.</p> <p>For a recent Android news app I developed, I wanted to use push messaging to inform users when new articles were published. This talk will describe how I used Firebase tools (Notifications, Cloud Messaging, Remote Config and Analytics) to implement custom notifications and analytics to track their performance.</p> <p>This is appropriate for Android developers who are interested in implementing push notifications with Firebase to re-engage their users. No prior experience with Firebase is needed.</p> <p><i>Eric began his career in the embedded world, writing cryptographic toolkits. Since 2010, he has been working in mobile, and is currently employed as an Android developer at Shopify. He has built a backend to deliver notifications to multiple mobile platforms, and has tinkered with Android cloud messaging technologies from C2DM onwards.</i></p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1473774690000,"duration":7200000,"id":"234091122","name":"Two Talks: Compound Components + AOSP","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1477434600000,"local_date":"2016-10-25","local_time":"18:30","rsvp_close_offset":"PT2H","updated":1478717873000,"utc_offset":-14400000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":77,"group":{"created":1455727991000,"name":"GDG Toronto Android","id":19584652,"join_mode":"open","lat":43.66999816894531,"lon":-79.38999938964844,"urlname":"ToAndroidDev","who":"Members","localized_location":"Toronto, ON","state":"ON","country":"ca","region":"en_US","timezone":"Canada/Eastern"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/ToAndroidDev/events/234091122/","description":"<p>COMPOUND COMPONENTS, Michelle Mendoza</p> <p>Have you ever had two layout components or view groups that you found you were using repeatedly?

Since hitting the 1.0 milestone early this year it has gained a lot of attention, specifically in the Android community, for its combination of modern features, high performance, and small runtime. Kotlin's emphasis on interoperability with Java has also made it an attractive option for developers maintaining large Java code-bases.I have been using Kotlin at work for the last 6-months to add new-features and refactor parts of an existing Android app. For this talk I will give an overview of Kotlin's features and syntax, and describe my experience of learning and working with the language. This talk is appropriate for anyone interested in learning about Kotlin, and will required no previous knowledge of the language.

With modern Android devices having enough processing power to run video processing algorithms locally, there's no need to send videos through expensive internet bandwidth to be processed on the backend. Overlays, transcoding and cropping are just a few of the challenges you face when working with video on-device. In this talk I will go through my experience experimenting with built-in as well as third party libraries for video manipulation on Android. We will look at the benefits of two leading media processing libraries, and how you can leverage them to enhance Android's native MediaCodec API to accomplish these tasks. You will walk away with a head start on how to tackle the most common challenges with videos on Android.</p> <p>Godfrey Nolan, \"Android Security\"</p> <p>This session takes a look at Android security from a developer rather than a hacker's perspective. Using the OWASP Top 10 Mobile risks, we look at how to protect your Android code, how to use secure authentication in your app, how to communicate securely with any backend server and how to safeguard that server against attack. Throughout the session we'll use real world examples from the many audits we've done over the years to show how other developers have tried and sometimes failed to secure their code.</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1497274119000,"id":"240730499","name":"Lightning ⚡️ Talks","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1500503400000,"local_date":"2017-07-19","local_time":"18:30","rsvp_close_offset":"PT2H","updated":1500561866000,"utc_offset":-14400000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":83,"group":{"created":1455727991000,"name":"GDG Toronto Android","id":19584652,"join_mode":"open","lat":43.66999816894531,"lon":-79.38999938964844,"urlname":"ToAndroidDev","who":"Members","localized_location":"Toronto, ON","state":"ON","country":"ca","region":"en_US","timezone":"Canada/Eastern"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/ToAndroidDev/events/240730499/","description":"<p>18:30  Check-in, socializing, food/drink<br/>19:00  Talks start<br/>20:30  Socializing</p> <p>• Teyvonia T – Developing Computer Vision Applications for Android</p> <p>• Phil S – Droidcon Boston vs. Chicago Roboto vs. Staying Home: Conference Recaps</p> <p>• Neal M – App Security -

With the goal of protecting developers from making mistakes, the Android ecosystem relies heavily on asynchronous APIs that can be found all over the framework and also in many third-party libraries. Although this might do the trick for simple apps and workflows, this becomes a problem as complexity grows in the codebase. In this talk, we'll explore how to leverage coroutines to convert asynchronous APIs into synchronous ones for the sake of expressiveness, readability and developer sanity.</p> <p>Composed and Compact with Kotlin Flow - Josh Allen<br/>Have you sweat buckets in your journey to mastering RxJava? Now Kotlin Flow is no longer just experimental and you're wondering if all that knowledge is obsolete. Embrace the future, and learn how the Flow can help you leverage your past expertise in beautiful new ways: composed, compact, and flowing with possibility.</p> <p>---<br/>Interested in giving a talk at the GDG Toronto Android meetup?
