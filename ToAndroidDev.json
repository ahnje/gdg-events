I started working with Android during the Froyo days and have never looked back.</i></p> <p><b>\u2022 The Basics of Custom UI, by Mark Iantorno</b></p> <p>Creating a memorable experience for users by including custom UI components is what separates your app from the others on the Play Store. More importantly, especially in settings like healthcare, good UI/UX is what encourages patients to continue using the apps you make. In this presentation, I\u2019ll provide a brief introduction into the basics of custom drawing on Android, and explain the most common operations available to you.</p> <p>About Mark:<br/><i>I\u2019ve been in the IT field as both a developer and project manager for almost a decade, working on everything from mobile games to cell phone network billing software. Over the last two and a half years, I\u2019ve had the privilege of working as an Android developer at the Centre For Global eHealth Innovation, a nonprofit research organization part of University Health Network.

But in practice, regular programming and software architecture are not that different. \u2018Architecture\u2019 is just how you manage code for the long term.</p> <p>If you\u2019re soon to lead a large Android project (or already are), I\u2019ll present a few tips to help you create a project that survives scaling-up and its inevitable onslaught of feature requests. We\u2019ll delve into S.O.L.I.D. principles and how they apply to Android, using a live code demo.</p> <p>Although some Android experience is useful for getting the most out of this talk, most of it is applicable to any programmer that wants to code at scale, in any language.</p> <p>◙ <b>Firebase Notifications, Eric Fung</b></p> <p>With only a minimum of coding, Firebase provides your Android app with simple push notifications and collects analytics to measure user engagement. However, if you need to customize the notifications or their behaviour, you need to implement everything yourself.</p> <p>For a recent Android news app I developed, I wanted to use push messaging to inform users when new articles were published. This talk will describe how I used Firebase tools (Notifications, Cloud Messaging, Remote Config and Analytics) to implement custom notifications and analytics to track their performance.</p> <p>This is appropriate for Android developers who are interested in implementing push notifications with Firebase to re-engage their users. No prior experience with Firebase is needed.</p> <p><i>Eric began his career in the embedded world, writing cryptographic toolkits. Since 2010, he has been working in mobile, and is currently employed as an Android developer at Shopify. He has built a backend to deliver notifications to multiple mobile platforms, and has tinkered with Android cloud messaging technologies from C2DM onwards.</i></p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1473774690000,"duration":7200000,"id":"234091122","name":"Two Talks: Compound Components + AOSP","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1477434600000,"local_date":"2016-10-25","local_time":"18:30","rsvp_close_offset":"PT2H","updated":1478717873000,"utc_offset":-14400000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":77,"group":{"created":1455727991000,"name":"GDG Toronto Android","id":19584652,"join_mode":"open","lat":43.66999816894531,"lon":-79.38999938964844,"urlname":"ToAndroidDev","who":"Members","localized_location":"Toronto, ON","state":"ON","country":"ca","region":"en_US","timezone":"Canada/Eastern"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/ToAndroidDev/events/234091122/","description":"<p>COMPOUND COMPONENTS, Michelle Mendoza</p> <p>Have you ever had two layout components or view groups that you found you were using repeatedly?

Since hitting the 1.0 milestone early this year it has gained a lot of attention, specifically in the Android community, for its combination of modern features, high performance, and small runtime. Kotlin's emphasis on interoperability with Java has also made it an attractive option for developers maintaining large Java code-bases.I have been using Kotlin at work for the last 6-months to add new-features and refactor parts of an existing Android app. For this talk I will give an overview of Kotlin's features and syntax, and describe my experience of learning and working with the language. This talk is appropriate for anyone interested in learning about Kotlin, and will required no previous knowledge of the language. While I will emphasize programming on Android, it should be applicable to anyone with a Java background.</p> <p><i>Adam Erb is a Java and Android developer at EBlock.ca.

Over the past decade, I've had the privilege of training dozens of promising junior developers. However, time and time again, I'm blown away by how little experience they have using the basic debugging tools provided by Google. This presentation aims to address this blind spot by highlighting the principal tools developers have at their disposal to identify and resolve bugs in their code. </p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1492623609000,"id":"239331369","name":"Two Talks: Video and Security","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1497306600000,"local_date":"2017-06-12","local_time":"18:30","rsvp_open_offset":"PT954H30M","updated":1497354423000,"utc_offset":-14400000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":93,"venue":{"id":23087232,"name":"Shopify Toronto","lat":43.64604949951172,"lon":-79.39557647705078,"repinned":false,"address_1":"80 Spadina Ave. 4th Floor","city":"Toronto","country":"ca","localized_country_name":"Canada","zip":"","state":"ON"},"group":{"created":1455727991000,"name":"GDG Toronto Android","id":19584652,"join_mode":"open","lat":43.66999816894531,"lon":-79.38999938964844,"urlname":"ToAndroidDev","who":"Members","localized_location":"Toronto, ON","state":"ON","country":"ca","region":"en_US","timezone":"Canada/Eastern"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/ToAndroidDev/events/239331369/","description":"<p>18:00 Doors open<br/>18:30 Mingle, pizza and drinks<br/>19:00 Talks start</p> <p>This month, Namrata Bandekar talks about local video processing, and a special guest from Detroit, Godfrey Nolan, talks about Android security from a developer perspective.</p> <p>Namrata Bandekar, \"Video Processing on Android\"</p> <p>An increasing number of social media apps such as Instagram, Snapchat and Messenger are using video features. With modern Android devices having enough processing power to run video processing algorithms locally, there's no need to send videos through expensive internet bandwidth to be processed on the backend. Overlays, transcoding and cropping are just a few of the challenges you face when working with video on-device. In this talk I will go through my experience experimenting with built-in as well as third party libraries for video manipulation on Android. We will look at the benefits of two leading media processing libraries, and how you can leverage them to enhance Android's native MediaCodec API to accomplish these tasks. You will walk away with a head start on how to tackle the most common challenges with videos on Android.</p> <p>Godfrey Nolan, \"Android Security\"</p> <p>This session takes a look at Android security from a developer rather than a hacker's perspective. Using the OWASP Top 10 Mobile risks, we look at how to protect your Android code, how to use secure authentication in your app, how to communicate securely with any backend server and how to safeguard that server against attack. Throughout the session we'll use real world examples from the many audits we've done over the years to show how other developers have tried and sometimes failed to secure their code.</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1497274119000,"id":"240730499","name":"Lightning ⚡️ Talks","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1500503400000,"local_date":"2017-07-19","local_time":"18:30","rsvp_close_offset":"PT2H","updated":1500561866000,"utc_offset":-14400000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":83,"group":{"created":1455727991000,"name":"GDG Toronto Android","id":19584652,"join_mode":"open","lat":43.66999816894531,"lon":-79.38999938964844,"urlname":"ToAndroidDev","who":"Members","localized_location":"Toronto, ON","state":"ON","country":"ca","region":"en_US","timezone":"Canada/Eastern"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/ToAndroidDev/events/240730499/","description":"<p>18:30  Check-in, socializing, food/drink<br/>19:00  Talks start<br/>20:30  Socializing</p> <p>\u2022 Teyvonia T \u2013 Developing Computer Vision Applications for Android</p> <p>\u2022 Phil S \u2013 Droidcon Boston vs. Chicago Roboto vs. Staying Home: Conference Recaps</p> <p>\u2022 Neal M \u2013 App Security -
