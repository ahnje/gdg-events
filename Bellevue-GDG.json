You will see how to to authenticate and authorize your users and then synchronize user data preferences across devices using Amazon Cognito, a user identity and data synchronization service. You will see how quickly you can add powerful and scalable cloud services like Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) to download assets dynamically from within your game  and Amazon DynamoDB to store, share and query user data. You will see how Amazon Mobile Analytics service collects, visualizes and understand your mobile app usage at scale. how how you could use Amazon Simple Notification Service's (SNS) Mobile Push Messaging to transmit notifications to Apple, Google, and Kindle Fire devices using a single unified API.In this session, you will learn how to use the single unified and optimized easy-to-use AWS Mobile SDK so developers can access these new services (and other services like S3, DynamoDB) with just a few lines of code on the client and without the need of owning a backend servers. ou will also  see how you could use Amazon Simple Notification Service's (SNS) Mobile Push Messaging to transmit notifications to Apple, Google, and Kindle Fire devices using a single unified API.</p> <p>Jinesh Varia is just another geek at AWS. He joined AWS right when Amazon announced its first service Amazon S3 (in early 2006). Since then, he has been helping developers and businesses take advantage of cloud computing services and helped build a strong technology platform and brand that people love. These days, he is passionate about Mobile and connected devices and works for AWS Mobile Services Team. Jinesh has spoken at various conferences, executive briefings, education institutions around the world and published various whitepapers and articles in journals, conferences and magazines. </p> <p>This will be a great presentation that offers deep insights into the mobile AWS ecosystem.  <br/>Our guest speaker will start at 6pm, come a little earlier to get some food and drinks and network with other professionals. The talk will last about 2hrs </p> <p>If you would like to attend this meetup please goto the EventBrite link below RSVP.  Thanks!</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/getting-started-with-aws-mobile-sdk-for-android-and-aws-mobile-services-tickets-13722052027\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/getting-started-with-aws-mobile-sdk-for-android-and-aws-mobile-services-tickets-13722052027</a></p> ","how_to_find_us":"TMobile - Two Newport 3625 132nd Ave SE, Bellevue, WA","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1422319808000,"duration":10800000,"id":"220103410","name":"Android and BLE: Best Practices and what's new in Android 5.0","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1422581400000,"local_date":"2015-01-29","local_time":"17:30","updated":1424196193000,"utc_offset":-28800000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":47,"venue":{"id":23598851,"name":"HTC Bellevue","lat":47.58010482788086,"lon":-122.1544189453125,"repinned":false,"address_1":"13920 SE Eastgate Way ","city":"Bellevue","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"","state":"WA"},"group":{"created":1412476817000,"name":"Bellevue Google Developer Group - GDG","id":17404842,"join_mode":"open","lat":47.619998931884766,"lon":-122.20999908447266,"urlname":"Bellevue-GDG","who":"Bellevue GDG","localized_location":"Bellevue, WA","state":"WA","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Pacific"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/Bellevue-GDG/events/220103410/","description":"<p>Android 5.0 is here and the new Bluetooth Low Energy package, android.bluetooth.le alone has more than 140 new APIs not counting all the under the cover changes and improvements.

It takes care of image loading and display so you don't have to. Fresco's image pipeline will load images from the network, local storage, or local resources. To save data and CPU, it has three levels of cache; two in memory and another in internal storage. Fresco's Drawees show a placeholder for you until the image has loaded and automatically show to the image when it arrives. When the image goes off-screen, it automatically releases its memory. Fresco supports Android 2.3 (Gingerbread) and later.</p> ","how_to_find_us":"Woodridge Building.

Limited screen size of a smartphone doesn’t lend itself to in-depth analysis. Couple this with the fact that many mobile users won't even be sitting down when they access their dashboards and it becomes apparent that certain types of data just won't be monitored on mobile devices.  How should you approach designing a dashboard for mobile devices? What information should you show? What are the common mistakes people make when designing a mobile dashboard? Join us to learn about it.</p> <p><i>Tatyana Yakushev is a 16-year veteran in software engineering. Currently she works in a mobile division at Tableau Software. Previously she has worked on user interfaces for business intelligence and machine learning software at Microsoft and Predixion.</i></p> <p><b>Android UI Testing by Yenchi Lin</b></p> <p>Do you test on Android? Yenchi will share with you how to  bootstrapp your existing app with simple UI functional test to get the most preliminary coverage in place and ready to add more tests.</p> <p><i>Yenchi Lin - Android developer since 2009, mainly worked on consumer facing apps.  Joined MetaBrite in late 2014 and worked on their CookBrite app, an app developed with TDD principle.  </i></p> <p><b>Reactive Programming by Wilson Burhan</b></p> <p>The Reactive Extensions were started at Microsoft for .NET, but now have been ported to Java by Netflix! They were designed to easily and reliably model data in motion as streams that can be combined, filtered and queried. In this talk I will introduce why reactive programming is a fantastic idea and how it can benefit not only your Android applications, but the way you program as well.</p> <p><i>Wilson Burhan is a UW graduate working on Android development professionally for about 1.5 years at OfferUp. Prior to that, he was a .NET developer for 1.5 years at a financial investment firm. </i></p> <p><b>Cognitive Services by Delong Fu</b></p> <p>What is Cognitive Services? It’s a set of REST API of award winning artificial intelligence algorithms that Microsoft is providing to developers of all kinds (with or without knowledge of AI). We believe in democratizing AI and allow developers to make their apps more human and intuitive. Delong will give an overview of the services and show you how to get started integrating these services with your Android apps.</p> <p><i>Delong Fu is a Software Developer Engineer at Microsoft research on the Microsoft Cognitive Services team.</i></p> <p><b>SCHEDULE</b></p> <p>• 6:00 - 6:30PM food &amp; mingle</p> <p>• 6:30 - 7:30PM lightning talks</p> <p>• 8:00PM meetup ends</p> <p><b>DIRECTIONS</b></p> <p>Offerup is located Bellefield office park <b>Woodridge Building</b>.</p> <p>Go to <a href=\"http://bellefield-officepark.com/locations/\"><a href=\"http://bellefield-officepark.com/locations/\" class=\"linkified\">http://bellefield-officepark.com/locations/</a></a> and click on <b>download campus map</b>.
