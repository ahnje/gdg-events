But‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs take it slow. First, let‚Äôs talk about machine learning: is the scientific study of algorithms that computer systems use in order to perform a task without explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead. There‚Äôs a lot of tools that allow us to create systems based on ‚Äútraining data‚Äù, but on this workshop, only the scikit-learn will be the used tool.</p> <p>Scikit-learn features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms, and this is just the tip of the iceberg. It is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy. Besides the fact that was created 12 years ago, it‚Äôs is a tool that is described as ‚Äúwell maintained and popular‚Äù.</p> <p>A lot of worldwide companies use scikit-learn to improve their services, through standard algorithms for prediction tasks, such as Spotify, Evernote and Booking.com, to improve their service quality and user satisfaction.</p> <p>If you are curious about this tool, you can check more information and documentation through this URL: <a href=\"https://scikit-learn.org/\" class=\"linkified\">https://scikit-learn.org/</a>.

As you can imagine, this adds an overload of processing to the server, beyond what your app really needs.</p> <p>That's why they come up with containers. With containers, you can deploy and run distributed applications without launching an entire virtual machine for each application.</p> <p>Each container image has all the runtime components (such as files, environment variables, and libraries) necessary to run any application, isolated from others ones. Besides that, they are lightweight processes that have some additional features that enable them to create an abstraction layer over the network infrastructure and over the operating system.</p> <p>Application containerization is also associated with microservices. This development architecture is used when an extensive monolithic application is split into modules that are specific for each task.</p> <p>But, how to manage containers, deployments, scaling, and failover of your application? That's why Kubernetes is used for!</p> <p>WHAT IS KUBERNETES?</p> <p>Kubernetes is an open-source platform that makes easy the tasks of managing containerized workloads and services, and deployment patterns (like the Blue-Green deployment).</p> <p>You can create new containers for your deployment, remove existing containers, and configure the limitations of their resources (CPU limitations, etc.).</p> <p>For example, if traffic to a container is high, Kubernetes can load balance and distribute the network traffic, keeping the deployment stable. Once configured by the developer, the system automatically handles it.</p> <p>Kubernetes can restart containers that fail, replaces containers, kills containers that don't respond, and much more!</p> <p>TELL ME MORE ABOUT THE EVENT:</p> <p>The event will take place on the 14th of December 2019 at 09:30 am in the Jesuits' College of Funchal (<a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/S1PGEamLtm42\" class=\"linkified\">https://goo.gl/maps/S1PGEamLtm42</a>), one of the most remarkable historic buildings of the island, with more than 400 years of existence.</p> <p>The lab contents will be in English.
