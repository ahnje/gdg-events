That might mean creating a class hierarchy, it might mean using protocol-oriented programming, it might mean using generics, or any number of other techniques – they all make code useful in more than once place.</p> <p>A design pattern is the ability to reuse ideas. It’s the ability to say “last time we hit a problem similar to this, we solved it by…” and then outlining a solution you know to have worked previously. You never remember the exact code you wrote, but you do remember your structure, the advantages, the disadvantages, and any implications for the rest of your project.</p> <p>A design pattern is the ability to say to say, “we can solve this using a template method,” and have everyone else understand what you mean – and understand the same advantages, disadvantages, and implications that you had in your head. We all take this kind of shared vocabulary for granted when talking about things like classes, generics, and extensions – things that have entirely different meanings outside of programming – and it’s just as useful when applied to ideas.</p> <p>In this workshop you’ll get hands-on examples of the most important patterns available to Swift developers, so you can try using them, re-using them, and refactoring them into your own work.<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>TICKET LINK: <a href=\"https://www.xing-events.com/DevFestBaltics2018.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.xing-events.com/DevFestBaltics2018.html</a></p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1541144639000,"duration":14400000,"id":"256061123","name":"Build your first Android app!","rsvp_limit":37,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1542441600000,"local_date":"2018-11-17","local_time":"10:00","updated":1542457945000,"utc_offset":7200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":37,"venue":{"id":13952842,"name":"Baltic Beach SPA and Resort Hotel","lat":56.97539138793945,"lon":23.79764175415039,"repinned":true,"address_1":"Jūras iela 23/25","address_2":"LV-2015","city":"Jūrmala","country":"lv","localized_country_name":"Latvia","phone":"+371 67 771 400"},"group":{"created":1458397731000,"name":"Google Developer Group Riga","id":19730024,"join_mode":"open","lat":56.970001220703125,"lon":24.1299991607666,"urlname":"GDG-Riga","who":"Members","localized_location":"Riga, Latvia","state":"","country":"lv","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Riga"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Riga/events/256061123/","description":"<p>Have you ever wondered how to write an Android app?
