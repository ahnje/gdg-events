Join us for a Machine Learning Study Jam where we will run through the Machine Learning Crash Course (MLCC)!</p> <p>This course is intended for those who wish to learn about ML from a practical, applied perspective that will enable you to use machine learning in your everyday projects and learn about the power of TensorFlow. This is a great opportunity for anyone with basic technical knowledge and limited Machine Learning knowledge willing to gain some practical experience in ML and TensorFlow.</p> <p>This course will be suitable for you, if:<br/>*You are a strong programmer<br/>*Ideally, you are at least somewhat familiar with Python. You don't need to be an expert.<br/>*Ideally, you know at least a little about linear algebra and calculus.<br/>This course is not recommended for:<br/>*Participants with extensive machine learning backgrounds.<br/>*Participants looking to learn about the lower-level intricacies of raw TensorFlow. Although the course does contain some basic TensorFlow exercises, most of the exercises focus on high-level Tensor APIs.<br/>*Participants seeking advanced topics in machine learning such as image convolutional models and recurrent/sequential models.</p> <p>**Bring your laptop and headphones! **</p> <p>For the lunch break, you can go out and eat somewhere or bring your food and eat at the venue. Please remember to be back on time for the next modules.</p> <p>Agenda:<br/>11PM: event start<br/>11:30PM: overview &amp; first 3 modules of MLCC<br/>1:30PM: lunch break<br/>2:30PM: TensorFlow modules<br/>4:00PM: event end</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1535907984000,"duration":7200000,"id":"254329331","name":"Cybersecurity and Data Privacy Tips","rsvp_limit":18,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1536939000000,"local_date":"2018-09-14","local_time":"17:30","updated":1536949597000,"utc_offset":7200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":12,"venue":{"id":25928307,"name":"Denk mal","lat":46.956748962402344,"lon":7.445450782775879,"repinned":false,"address_1":"Lagerweg 12 3013 ","city":"Bern ","country":"CH","localized_country_name":"Switzerland"},"group":{"created":1515946337000,"name":"GDG Bern","id":27154747,"join_mode":"open","lat":46.95000076293945,"lon":7.440000057220459,"urlname":"GDG-Bern","who":"Members","localized_location":"Bern, Switzerland","state":"","country":"ch","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Zurich"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Bern/events/254329331/","description":"<p>In this meetup we will introduce some basic security and privacy recommendations while browsing in Internet, using your smartphone or checking your email.<br/>This talk is targeted for non-technical people or technical people who never care about cybersecurity nor data privacy.
