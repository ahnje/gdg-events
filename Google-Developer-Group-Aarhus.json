This is THE biggest event for developers working with Google technologies and we get to hear about what's new and upcoming for the coming year.</p> <p>Trifork together with Google Developer Group Aarhus wish to provide you with the chance of seeing the keynote in a nice setting with other like-minded nerds – hopefully creating an exciting environment and good discussion. So join us at Dokk1 in Aarhus for this Google I/O Extended event.</p> <p>As an added bonus, some of our local Google Aarhus engineers have promised to join us and there will be a talk about some of the newest developments from the teams they are part of (more details to come) before or after the keynote. so don't miss out on this chance to interact directly with Googlers and pick their brains about software development and tech.</p> <p>At the event, we will provide food and drinks throughout the evening. The Keynote itself will be streamed on a large screen.</p> <p>We hope to see you for an entertaining and exciting evening full of surprises and announcements from Google. </p> <p>As always - it is free to attend, but you must sign up through here on meetup.
