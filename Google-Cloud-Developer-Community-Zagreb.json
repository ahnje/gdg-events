In his free time, he organizes Hacking Machine Learning meetup in Munich, that currently has more than 1300 members and hosts monthly events.<br/>Over the weekends he enjoys sharing his knowledge as a conference speaker or open source and machine learning ambassador.</p> <p>In his work time, he works on democratizing fashion with Stylight, one of the biggest fashion communities in the world. Given more than 30 million products live over more than 1000 shops in 17 countries, using machine learning and data science is one of the ways to make Stylight a great place to discover products.</p> <p>News are going crazy about AI. Companies, raise hundreds of millions on just mentioning keywords of Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning. But what does it mean for actual production use-case? Where is the line between the hype and how easy is to apply these technologies?</p> <p>In the talk, we start with basic concepts of machine learning, explaining tensors and advantages of Tensorflow, shifting more into the direction of practical examples of how one can apply mentioned technologies without going too deep into mathematics.</p> <p>The talks cover techniques that were announced at TensorFlow Dev Summit this year. With these tools, one can prototype solution fast, without the need to go too deep. Additionally, we also cover, the last mile: how to bring such solutions to the users covering both cluster server serving with TensorFlow Serving as well as mobile serving with Tensorflow Lite and even the brand new MLKit.</p> ","how_to_find_us":"Black building inside Algebra Campus, second floor Algebra LAB","visibility":"public"},{"created":1543174965000,"duration":7200000,"id":"256698091","name":"Podržano/ojačano učenje (reinforcement learning) na primjeru igre Flappy Bird","rsvp_limit":100,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1544806800000,"local_date":"2018-12-14","local_time":"18:00","rsvp_close_offset":"PT6H","updated":1544817905000,"utc_offset":3600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":42,"venue":{"id":24855197,"name":"Algebra Visoko Učilište","lat":45.814701080322266,"lon":15.945540428161621,"repinned":true,"address_1":"Ilica 242","city":"Zagreb","country":"hr","localized_country_name":"Croatia"},"group":{"created":1534445791000,"name":"Google Cloud Developer Community Zagreb","id":29541809,"join_mode":"open","lat":45.79999923706055,"lon":15.970000267028809,"urlname":"Google-Cloud-Developer-Community-Zagreb","who":"Members","localized_location":"Zagreb, Croatia","state":"","country":"hr","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Zagreb"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/Google-Cloud-Developer-Community-Zagreb/events/256698091/","description":"<p>Korištenje DeepMind-ovih revolucionarnih AI pristupa traži dosta truda, ali rezultati su zapanjujući.<br/>Ova prezentacija Vas vodi kroz osnovne dijelove podržanog/ojačanog učenja na primjeru treniranja neuronskih mreža na primjeru igre Flappy bird koristeći PyTorch framework.</p> <p>Predavanje vodi Neven Pičuljan R&amp;D inženjer u području deep learninga i machine learninga sa nekoliko godina radnog iskustva.<br/>Kroz vrijeme je skupio dosta iskustva u radu sa novim tehnologijama,<br/>a jedan od glavnih framework-a koje trenutno koristi je PyTorch uz što još kombinira C i C++.</p> ","how_to_find_us":"Glavni ulaz u Algebra kampus, žuta zgrada sa lijeve strane prvi ulaz u zgradu i prvi hodnik lijevo dvorana \"Ruđer Bošković\"","visibility":"public"}]
