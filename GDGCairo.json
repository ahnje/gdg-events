Although the course does contain some basic TensorFlow exercises, most of the exercises focus on high-level Tensor APIs.<br/>- Participants seeking advanced topics in machine learning such as image convolutional models and recurrent/sequential models.</p> <p>Speaker:<br/>Mohamed Hegazy - R&amp;D Engineer at e-finance</p> <p>Agenda:<br/>11:00 AM - 11:30 AM: Registration - Meet and Greet<br/>11:30 AM - 11:40 AM: Overview of MLCC<br/>11:40 AM - 01:15 PM: Going Through Farming, ML, and Reducing Loss<br/>01:15 PM - 01:30 PM: Break<br/>01:30 PM - 02:45 PM: Introduction to TensorFlow + Exercises<br/>02:45 PM - 03:00PM: Final words and wrap-up</p> <p>IMPORTANT: Registration is required via this form: <a href=\"https://goo.gl/forms/kSRHqGzCu9utrzP93\" class=\"linkified\">https://goo.gl/forms/kSRHqGzCu9utrzP93</a></p> ","how_to_find_us":"AlMaqarr Coworking Space","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1524435811000,"duration":90000000,"id":"250048729","name":"Android Study Jam","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1524830400000,"local_date":"2018-04-27","local_time":"14:00","updated":1525353420000,"utc_offset":7200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":33,"venue":{"id":24431436,"name":"The GrEEK Campus","lat":30.04363441467285,"lon":31.239013671875,"repinned":false,"address_1":"28 Falaki St., Bab El Louk","city":"Cairo","country":"EG","localized_country_name":"Egypt"},"group":{"created":1496036332000,"name":"GDG Cairo","id":24109236,"join_mode":"open","lat":30.059999465942383,"lon":31.25,"urlname":"GDGCairo","who":"Members","localized_location":"Cairo, Egypt","state":"","country":"eg","region":"en_US","timezone":"Africa/Cairo"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDGCairo/events/250048729/","manual_attendance_count":47,"description":"<p>IMPORTANT: REGISTRATION IS REQUIRED VIA THIS FORM: <a href=\"https://goo.gl/forms/80igoafhVd6yFUuh2\" class=\"linkified\">https://goo.gl/forms/80igoafhVd6yFUuh2</a></p> <p>If you are a student, fresh graduate who has a basic knowledge in JavaSE and need to join Android world, this workshop will be perfect for you!</p> <p>As an attendee you will:<br/>- Learn about Android Components.<br/>- Learn XML Syntax, RecyclerView, Custom Adapter, ..etc.<br/>- Make Coffee app and Android Flavor app.</p> <p>Agenda:<br/>1st day (Friday Apr 27 from 2pm to 6pm):<br/>-- Registration 2:00pm - 2:30pm<br/>-- Android Session 2:30pm - 4:00pm<br/>‚Ä¢ Android Platform Architecture<br/>‚Ä¢ Android Studio<br/>‚Ä¢ Android Component<br/>‚Ä¢ View &amp; ViewGroup‚Äôs<br/>‚Ä¢ XML Syntax<br/>-- Break 4:00pm - 4:15pm<br/>-- Workshop 4:15pm - 5:45pm<br/>‚Ä¢ Make Coffee App<br/>-- Networking 5:45pm - 6:00pm</p> <p>2nd day (Saturday Apr 28 from 11am to 3pm):<br/>-- Registration 11:00pm - 11:30pm<br/>-- Android Session 11:30pm - 1:00pm<br/>‚Ä¢ Intents<br/>‚Ä¢ RecyclerView &amp; Custom Adapter<br/>-- Break 1:00pm - 1:15pm<br/>-- Workshop 1:15pm - 2:45pm<br/>‚Ä¢ Make Android Flavor app<br/>-- Networking 2:45pm - 3:00pm</p> <p>IMPORTANT: REGISTRATION IS REQUIRED VIA THIS FORM: <a href=\"https://goo.gl/forms/80igoafhVd6yFUuh2\" class=\"linkified\">https://goo.gl/forms/80igoafhVd6yFUuh2</a></p> ","how_to_find_us":"AlMaqarr Coworking Space","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1520804703000,"duration":19800000,"id":"248643280","name":"Google Assistant - Build Actions for Your Community","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1530358200000,"local_date":"2018-06-30","local_time":"13:30","updated":1530985476000,"utc_offset":7200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":131,"venue":{"id":24601838,"name":"Mushtarak","lat":30.040748596191406,"lon":31.202030181884766,"repinned":false,"address_1":"37, Amman Street, Dokki","city":"Cairo","country":"eg","localized_country_name":"Egypt"},"group":{"created":1496036332000,"name":"GDG Cairo","id":24109236,"join_mode":"open","lat":30.059999465942383,"lon":31.25,"urlname":"GDGCairo","who":"Members","localized_location":"Cairo, Egypt","state":"","country":"eg","region":"en_US","timezone":"Africa/Cairo"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDGCairo/events/248643280/","manual_attendance_count":40,"description":"<p>** RSVP &amp; REGISTRATION REQUIRED TO ATTEND THIS EVENT **<br/><a href=\"https://goo.gl/forms/FzGcOPsKX2XWamJ92\" class=\"linkified\">https://goo.gl/forms/FzGcOPsKX2XWamJ92</a><br/>----------------------------------------------<br/>YOUR REGISTRATION IS SUBJECT TO APPROVAL OR REJECTION ACCORDING TO YOUR RESPONSES AND SEATS AVAILABILITY!

We're offering opportunities to developers attending the event to learn how to build Actions for the Google Assistant that are useful for their community - whether it's a professional network, interest group, or your hometown. This way, you can build something in an area that you care about or are interested in.</p> <p>‚Ä¢ WHAT IS THE END RESULT<br/>This event series is targeting all levels of developers and we hope to see some great Actions on Google come out as a result and all of you having a ton of fun exploring what you can do with Google Assistant. We‚Äôll provide you with content to learn how to create and actually build Actions on Google. Actions will be featured online and may even be showcased at the Google I/O Community Lounge.</p> <p>‚Ä¢ IMPORTANT TO BRING<br/>Bring a laptop (PC, Mac or Chromebook)!
