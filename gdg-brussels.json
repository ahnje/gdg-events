Well, we don't know how it works but we want to learn, so we wanted to get together with whoever else is interested and see what we can learn from this new platform.</p> <p>Here is how it's going to work: we'll bring a few Android Things compatible devices along with some breadboards, wires and LEDs. We'll have downloaded the platform and whatever else is needed on flash drives. And during the meetup we'll make a few groups, and each group will try to figure out how this works and what could be done with it.</p> <p>How does that sound?<br/>This is a very experimental new kind of meetup and we can change everything as we go along, the purpose is to learn and have fun :)</p> <p>Of course, if one of you have done something with it already and would like to share, please do! :)</p> <p>So because we do not have that much hardware, the places will be limited. If you really want to come please RSVP so we have an idea of people attending, and if you change your mind make sure to change your RSVP so that others can come.</p> <p>Don't be afraid to use the comments to ask questions, leave suggestions and remarks about this type of event.<br/>Also, if you have a Raspberry Pi 3 laying around not doing anything, feel free to bring it also so that we can have more hardware :)</p> <p>I hope to see you there.

But why should you actually care? What are the benefits for you and your team? How should a modularized app look like? And how do you start splitting your app?</p> <p>In this talk you will learn why modularization matters and how a modularized architecture looks like. We’ll study a real-life example project and investigate how modules are setup, organized and configuration is shared across modules. Finally you’ll learn how you can start modularizing your existing app and I’ll share what lessons we learned while doing so at Philips Hue.</p> <p>Agenda:<br/>- 18:30: Welcome<br/>- 19:00: Jeroen will present his talk<br/>- 20:00: Discussions<br/>- 21:00: End</p> <p>Once again, this event is very graciously sponsored by Computer Futures (<a href=\"https://www.computerfutures.com\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.computerfutures.com</a>).<br/>It is a well established IT recruiting and contracting company.
