Women of all technical expertise and levels are encouraged to attend. No programming experience needed.</p> <p><b>I see that your event has workshops... Do those cost extra to attend?</b></p> <p>They are free! Workshops are available free of cost to registered attendees. Workshop topics cover a variety of tech-related topics, and are led by super-talented women too!</p> <p><b>Why the asterisk on women?</b></p> <p>The word “women” can seem exclusive and alienating to some. We use the asterisk to include anyone who identifies as cis-women, trans*, intersex and queer people who identify as women.</p> <p><b>Do I need to bring anything?</b></p> <p>A laptop is recommended. Don’t have one? No worries! Just bring your awesome self.</p> <p><b>Do you provide childcare?</b></p> <p>Yes, we do! We provide childcare during the workshops portion of the event from 9:15-2:15.</p> <p><b>Do I have to stay all day on both days?</b></p> <p>Nope! Stay as long as you like, and come and go as you please.</p> <p><b>Will there be prizes?</b></p> <p>Heck yeah! Prizes in several categories, too (again, you don't *have* to be a coder to participate).</p> <p><b>So... do you think I should attend?</b></p> <p>Heck yes! This is a great opportunity to network and collaborate with women techies of all levels. Also, this is your chance to bring your cool app idea, website idea, or product idea to life.</p> <p><b>I can’t contain myself. How do I sign up?</b></p> <p>I thought you’d ask!
