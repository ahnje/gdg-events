This is a joint meetup with our friends from Bucharest Java User Group</p> <p>Agenda:</p> <p>- Ana-Maria Mihalceanu - Kubernetes and the 12 factors cloud applications<br/>The 12-factor app methodology (<a href=\"https://12factor.net\" class=\"linkified\">https://12factor.net</a>) represents a best practice when comes to cloud application development and for the past years many developers employ it in order to facilitate both their current and future work. Kubernetes, with its cloud-agnostic container deployments, complements the 12 factors apps with their flavors across frameworks and cloud providers. This presentation is intended for all those curious on how to manipulate their code and Kubernetes as well in its use as a developer but also as operational. Each of the principles will be illustrated by a demo.</p> <p>Ana-Maria is a custom application development enthusiast, co-founder of Bucharest Software Craftsmanship Community and a constant adopter of challenging technical scenarios. In 2016, as tech passionate of cloud application development she achieved IBM Certified Application Developer - Cloud Platform v1. Since then, she has enriched her cloud expertise by learning and certifying as a Salesforce Developer and attained a better understanding on how to integrate different types of cloud offerings.
