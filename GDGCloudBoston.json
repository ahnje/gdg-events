Our new Google Cloud Talks series is built for Cloud users to learn and network after hours. Each month, we’ll bring together a community of IT practitioners at our Google offices to discuss key features of Google Cloud with our Customer Engineering experts. We’ll dive into the products, tools, and new features that matter most to your career as you modernize IT with Google Cloud.</p> <p>Summary</p> <p>Nobody has an IoT problem. Many people have a business problem which can be solved in whole or in part through the use of IoT technology. In this session, we'll leave the world of Raspberry Pi behind and talk about how Smart Connected Products are working to solve current business problems that are all around us. We’ll also explore how Google Cloud’s IoT tools and scalability make it the most flexible choice for your IoT solution.</p> <p>Agenda</p> <p>6:00 PM - 6:30 PM - Check-in and refreshments<br/>6:30 PM - 7:45 PM - Welcome address and presentation<br/>7:45 PM - 9:00 PM - Reception and networking</p> <p>Speakers</p> <p>Kevin Holbrook, Cloud Customer Engineer</p> <p>Kevin Holbrook is a Cloud Customer Engineer who has spent the last 10 years working the IoT space (or ”M2M” as we used to say back in the day).

Location has changed, but it is still on the T.]</p> <p>Join us to hear Philipp Maier of Google Cloud talk about GCP networking.</p> <p>Consider for a second the impact Google Search has on our daily lives with timely and relevant responses. Now, think of other Google products – Gmail, Maps, Chrome, YouTube, Android, Play. Each of these products has over 1 billion monthly users. Google had to develop networking technologies to meet the requirements of a distributed computing infrastructure that can support those billions of users. Google Cloud’s goal is to share these innovations and infrastructure with others so that they can also impact and delight their users.</p> <p>Philipp Maier will discuss GCP networking at both introductory and advanced levels, highlighting the strengths of using state-of-the-art software-defined networking and distributed systems technologies, such as Virtual Private Cloud networks, and global Load Balancers. Advanced features covered will include Network Service Tiers, and several interconnect options that are useful in hybrid and multi-cloud architectures.</p> <p>Should you desire formal training on GCP networking, you'll be in good hands.

Do you want to build that infrastructure? Of course not! Your time is better spent focusing on the app. In this talk, we'll take a look at the code for a mobile app that works like a “universal translator”. It uses Firebase and Google Cloud services and APIs. And we'll do it \"serverless\" without having to manage servers or infrastructure. A live demo of the app will be done with audience participation - bring a phone or laptop!</p> <p>WHO SHOULD ATTEND: Anyone who wants to see how Firebase developers cross into Google Cloud, or Google Cloud developers who are interested in using Cloud infrastructure to power realtime mobile apps.</p> <p>THE SPEAKER:<br/>Doug is a veteran engineer, experienced public speaker, and developer advocate at Google with the Firebase team. He developed web apps before the web had \"apps\", and developed for Android since the very first Android device was on the market. In the SF bay area, he's bootstrapped the efforts of several startups. Outside of work, Doug follows professional ice hockey and enjoys craft beer.</p> <p>SECOND PRESENTATION<br/>Serverless CI/CD on Google Cloud Platform<br/>Lynn Langit @lynnlangit<br/>GDE, Cloud Architect</p> <p>ABSTRACT<br/>In this talk see the newly released GCP Cloud Build service in action.
