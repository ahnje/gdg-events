Analytics platforms are similar: data visualizations are typically what the user sees, but much of the complexity of end-to-end data delivery is hidden beneath the surface.</p> <p>In this presentation, we’ll dive into the ocean with both Google Data Studio and Looker to see how complete analytics solutions are built using each platform. We’ll consider the role of data engineering, data prep, and data modeling in producing the catalog we source for data visualizations, and we’ll also explore how these products can be used to power analytics in external applications.</p> <p>Speaker:</p> <p>Stewart Bryson, CEO &amp; Founder @Red Pill Analytics<br/>Stewart Bryson is the founder and CEO of Red Pill Analytics, and has been designing and implementing data and analytics systems since 1996.
