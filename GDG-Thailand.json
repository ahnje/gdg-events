Together with the GDG leads, coordinate and lead classes and get more people like you certified!</p> <p>This is a chance to get a professional accreditation that demonstrates you have an understanding of basic and advanced aspects of mobile website design and development. By learning together we think it’s going to be more fun and more of us are going to be able to complete it.</p> <p>Requirements<br/>You need basic web development skills to take part and it typically it takes 3-4 hours to run through the course materials, followed by a 90 minute multiple choice exam. You can find more details on the course here. It’s possible to do it entirely online alone, but we’d like to run through it together as a group.</p> <p>Why do it?<br/>There is more traffic to mobile sites than desktop yet most sites don’t provide an effective experience for users. Best practice is changing rapidly so what people may have learned a few years ago may not be up to date. For companies and site owners we see better mobile design leading to significant and measurable improvements in customer acquisition, retention and engagement.</p> <p>Contact<br/>Facebook: Google Developer Group Thailand</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1524548613000,"duration":3600000,"id":"250091597","name":"Google Developer Day Extended","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1524549600000,"local_date":"2018-04-24","local_time":"13:00","updated":1528102949000,"utc_offset":25200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":1,"group":{"created":1492593505000,"name":"GDG Thailand","id":23339535,"join_mode":"open","lat":13.729999542236328,"lon":100.5,"urlname":"GDG-Thailand","who":"developers","localized_location":"Bangkok, Thailand","state":"","country":"th","region":"en_US","timezone":"Asia/Bangkok"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Thailand/events/250091597/","manual_attendance_count":94,"description":"<p>Build with Google Developers is event held by GDG and GDE to help startups and developers<br/>learn how to integrate their product with new technology and reach next billion user market.<br/>This December event’s is intensive workshop held to advocate glimpse of new technology for upcoming year.</p> <p>12.00 Register<br/>13.00 Opening Remarks - Wittaya Assawasathain<br/>Intro to new Technology and new program!<br/>13.30 Chatbot Platform and Economy<br/>- Tanakrit Saisillapee, CTO, Hbot<br/>14.20 Android Architecture Component with Kotlin<br/>- Inaki Villar, GDE Android<br/>15.10 Firestore Best Practise<br/>- Jirawat Karanwittayakarn, GDE Firebase<br/>16.00 Networking</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1524548807000,"duration":3600000,"id":"250091626","name":"GDG DevFest Bangkok 2017","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1524549600000,"local_date":"2018-04-24","local_time":"13:00","updated":1528103287000,"utc_offset":25200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":2,"group":{"created":1492593505000,"name":"GDG Thailand","id":23339535,"join_mode":"open","lat":13.729999542236328,"lon":100.5,"urlname":"GDG-Thailand","who":"developers","localized_location":"Bangkok, Thailand","state":"","country":"th","region":"en_US","timezone":"Asia/Bangkok"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Thailand/events/250091626/","manual_attendance_count":420,"description":"<p>Learn about latest technology from experts<br/>and build product in a better way.</p> <p><img src=\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/a/6/2/event_470470850.jpeg\" /></p> <p><img src=\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/a/6/5/event_470470853.jpeg\" /></p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1524549083000,"duration":3600000,"id":"250091683","name":"Firebase AppFest Bangkok","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1524549600000,"local_date":"2018-04-24","local_time":"13:00","updated":1528103114000,"utc_offset":25200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":1,"group":{"created":1492593505000,"name":"GDG Thailand","id":23339535,"join_mode":"open","lat":13.729999542236328,"lon":100.5,"urlname":"GDG-Thailand","who":"developers","localized_location":"Bangkok, Thailand","state":"","country":"th","region":"en_US","timezone":"Asia/Bangkok"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Thailand/events/250091683/","manual_attendance_count":89,"description":"<p>ผู้เข้าแข่งขันจำนวน 25 ทีมที่ได้เข้าร่วม Firebase AppFest จะได้ workshop กับคุณ Mike McDonald และ คุณ Doug Stevenson จากที่ Firebase ที่บินตรงมาจากอเมริกา พร้อมได้รับการโค้ชจาก GDE และยังได้รับเสื้อและของที่ระลึกจาก Google พร้อมกับอาหารและเครื่องดื่มตลอดเวลาสองวัน</p> <p>ทุกคนจะได้รับ Firebase Hotsauce + Android Collectible + Firebase AppFest Tshirt และของที่ระลึกจาก FIrebase </p> <p>ของรางวัลสำหรับทีมที่ชนะเลิศ :</p> <p>Winner prize<br/>Google Home<br/>Chromecast<br/>(16) Android collectible set</p> <p>2nd prize<br/>Google Home<br/>(16) Android collectible set</p> <p>3rd prize<br/>Chromecast<br/>(16) Android collectible set</p> <p>Popular Vote <br/>Chromecast<br/>Special Android collectible</p> <p>ทีมที่ผ่านไปพรีเซนต์ผลงานในช่วงท้าย จะได้รับ Firebase Spinner และ Android Fluffy กับ Cardboard</p> <p>พิเศษ!
