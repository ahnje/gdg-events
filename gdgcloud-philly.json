This month we'll be learning all about Functions as a Service.</p> <p>Kubernetes is a fantastic place to run your applications. But it's resources and abstractions are at a fairly low level for common, every day development activities. Knative is a new open source project that extends kubernetes to help build modern, source centric and container based applications. It introduces three new higher-level abstractions: building, serving, and eventing. The combination of these three, along with istio, provide the building blocks for serverless solutions.</p> <p>Project riff is a function as a service framework for creating and running polyglot functions. Tight integrations exist between riff and Knative as components of riff have been contributed to Knative and Knative now powers riff.</p> <p>At this event, we'll introduce key components of Knative and riff. We will provision a new GKE cluster and install Knative and riff. We'll deploy a serverless solution that leverages each of the components.
