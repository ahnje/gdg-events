Talks are arranged one after the other during the sessions. Lightning talks are brief which requires the speaker to make their point clearly and rid the presentation of non-critical information.

Teams begin groupthink, ideas become stale, and it can be difficult to reinvigorate the growing sense of mundane development. It doesn't have to be this way. In fact, creating an inclusive architecture can help development go faster and become more cost effective.</p> <p>It's not difficult to begin adjusting your sails and beginning to create an architecture that is inclusive in nature to support junior developers, project managers, and designers. No application is too critical, complicated, or obscure to be able to achieve this. We'll talk through frameworks, tools, abstractions, and simple steps that can help you start building inclusively.</p> <p>We will also talk through how you can build a corresponding culture that allows inclusivity on your team, and why this is so critical to your business. We'll walk through processes you can incorporate, team roles, and how you can build a better template for the future of your business.</p> <p>RXJS - OPERATOR, WHAT’S YOUR REAL WORLD USE CASE? IMPORTANT OPERATORS IN RXJS EXPLAINED<br/>Are you overthinking RxJS? Overwhelmed by the ~70 operators available to you? Confused by the docs and need someone to explain to you what on earth the differences between all the -maps are? Are you using that operator right? What operator should you actually be using? How do other people use RxJS operators? This talk covers walks through lamens terms definitions and real world use cases for some of the most important operators out there so you can effectively maximize your use of RxJS and get clarity on what RxJS is doing in your application.</p> <p>!------------------------------!<br/>Since this is a joint event, RSVPs will be managed on Eventbrite.

Talks are arranged one after the other during the sessions. Lightning talks are brief which requires the speaker to make their point clearly and rid the presentation of non-critical information. This causes the audience to be more attentive to the speaker and gain a broader array of knowledge from the presentations given.<br/>-Wikipedia</p> <p>Attendees interested in presenting can signup to give a short, 5 minute talk on any topic they want (preferably technology-related please). Participants will have the opportunity to win prizes. This is meant to be a fun, light competition. It won't be an intense, heavily structured point system.

Since adopting Vue almost 2 years ago, we have learned many lessons. Most importantly, the power and flexability that Vue can bring to our projects. And with 50+ applications under our belts, Vue has become an indispensable tool for building amazing experiences for our clients. I’ll discuss our process, a few of our projects and in what ways we think we use Vue in a unique way.
