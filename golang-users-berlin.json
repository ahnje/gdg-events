Give her a warm welcome!</p> <p>Then again, one of our organizers, Alexander Surma, has been hired by Google and will move to London at the beginning of March.

In this talk, you will be introduced to the Microsoft Cognitive Services APIs and see how you can use them together with the Go programming language to transform your application. In addition, Go has rich support for concurrency, which enables you to perform a large number of API calls simultaneously (e.g.,face detection and identification, emotion recognition, OCR).This is about the power of machine learning at the end of an API call.</p> <p><b>20:00-20:30</b> Announcements, HR lost and found and break</p> <p><b>20:30-21:00</b> Semantic Addressing Extension for Go's net Package / Philipp Brüll</p> <p><b>21:00-end</b> Networking</p> <p><img src=\"https://a248.e.akamai.net/secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/a/8/a/600_457599562.jpeg\" /></p> <p><b>About our speakers</b></p> <p><b>Nicoleta Mihali </b>(<a href=\"https://twitter.com/nikk_mihali\">@nikk_mihali</a>) is a Technical Evangelist with Microsoft Germany with a focus on natural user interaction technologies, like Cognitive Services, Bot Framework, Cortana and Kinect.

However, it’s far from perfect: it can be slow and failure-prone because it interprets templates at runtime. A better solution would be a statically compiled template that combines the benefits of writing code by hand, while also being simple and fast to use.</p> <p>Rather than creating yet another templating system in Go (did we need another one?) I took this as a learning opportunity to write a static compiler for Go templates. The whole process took me about a two weeks, and I ended up creating Statictemplate, a tool that performs static compilation to improve performance, while still supporting all of the Go templating features.</p> <p>In this talk, I want to show how to use Statictemplate and I also want to share my journey writing it, in hopes of encouraging others into crafting their own tools in Go. Some of the things I’ve learned include:</p> <p>* How to write a code generator, while ensuring type safety.<br/>* How to statically analyze go types.<br/>* How much faster static code can be compared to dynamically interpreted.<br/>* How to call private functions (don’t tell anyone!).</p> <p><b>21:00-end</b> Networking</p> <p><img src=\"https://a248.e.akamai.net/secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/a/8/a/600_457599562.jpeg\" /></p> <p><b>About our speakers:</b></p> <p><b>Tuna Celik, home24<br/></b>Tuna is a long time backend developer with a deep and broad background and former CEO and CTO of JAKPARK SOLUTIONS (Turkey).

A happy feminist who advocates that coding is for everyone.</p> <p>ABOUT Tendermint | @tendermint_team</p> <p>The Tendermint open-source project began in 2014 originating from the idea that a distributed consensus mechanism can create a reliable system from unreliable, or unverified parts. The project originally started to address the speed, scalability, and environmental issues associated with Bitcoin. The Tendermint team tackled these cryptocurrency problems using Byzantine Fault Tolerance based “Proof of Stake” to gain consensus and securely maintain the validation of blockchains. A blockchain is formed by a community, or validators, who have the most “stake” in the game. A validators investment and reputation, their stake, are a surety to the validity and security of a blockchain. Tendermint was commissioned by the Interchain Foundation to develop the Cosmos Network, to address the Cambrian explosion of blockchain applications.</p> <p>Cheers,<br/>The Organizers™</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1533049610000,"duration":9000000,"id":"253339156","name":"December Golang meetup","rsvp_limit":200,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1544032800000,"local_date":"2018-12-05","local_time":"19:00","updated":1547208961000,"utc_offset":3600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":145,"venue":{"id":25899990,"name":"Simplesurance","lat":52.499961853027344,"lon":13.38494873046875,"repinned":true,"address_1":"Hallesches Ufer 60","city":"Berlin","country":"de","localized_country_name":"Germany"},"group":{"created":1311935214000,"name":"GDG Berlin Golang","id":2256641,"join_mode":"open","lat":52.52000045776367,"lon":13.380000114440918,"urlname":"golang-users-berlin","who":"Gophers","localized_location":"Berlin, Germany","state":"","country":"de","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Berlin"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/golang-users-berlin/events/253339156/","manual_attendance_count":75,"description":"<p>Hello Gophers,<br/>Merry Christmas!</p> <p>It's time to wrap up the year and plan for the next one, and for this year - Santa Claus arrived early and brought along a very special guest all the way from Florida: Brian Ketelsen!<br/>Hence also the date change from December 4 to December 5 :)</p> <p>If you'd like to give a talk - submit your proposals here: <a href=\"http://goo.gl/forms/54YvJT223F\" class=\"linkified\">http://goo.gl/forms/54YvJT223F</a></p> <p>If you'd like to suggest topics for the fishbowl session - submit your topic here: <a href=\"https://goo.gl/lORsp6\" class=\"linkified\">https://goo.gl/lORsp6</a></p> <p>If you have more ideas - talk to us at the Gophers slack: <a href=\"https://gophersinvite.herokuapp.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://gophersinvite.herokuapp.com/</a> in the #berlin channel, and follow us on twitter:<a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdgberlingolang\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/gdgberlingolang</a></p> <p>AGENDA</p> <p>19:00-19:25 Networking over drinks and pizza</p> <p>19:25-19:30 Welcome words</p> <p>19:30-20:00 Baur: a Go build tool for monorepos - Fabian Holler (Simplesurance)</p> <p>20:00-20:30 Announcements, HR lost &amp; found, break</p> <p>20:30-21:00 tinyGo, a Go compiler for microcontrollers - Brian Ketelsen (Microsoft, Gophercon)</p> <p>21:00-end Networking</p> <p>ABOUT OUR SPEAKERS</p> <p>Fabian Holler<br/>Fabian develops Go services and enhances the CI system at Simplesurance .

Sadly, the code in question can be our creation from a few years ago. What can we do to make the code more readable? To address this painful question I will dig into neurophysiology, cognitive intuition and source code, the origin of software complexity problem and how we can deal with it. The talk will follow decomposition, different ways to set navigation beacons within our code, how useful identifiers are crafted and how types are used as traps for future errors. Finally, I will talk about a \"gradual\" code writing technique that is not limited to a well-known \"gradual typing\".</p> <p>21:00-21:30 Panel: Code Readability and Communication / Elena Grahovac, Grigory Petrov, Luciano Ramalho, Bill Kennedy</p> <p>21:30-end Networking</p> <p>🎤 ABOUT OUR SPEAKERS 🎤</p> <p>Luciano Ramalho (@ramalhoorg) is the O'Reilly author of Fluent Python.
