Dart fixes JavaScript’s most serious problems as listed in the book “JavaScript: The Good Parts” by Douglas Crockford. Dart translates to JavaScript that is competitive with the performance of hand-coded JavaScript. </p> <p>2) Dart has modern programming features and concise, yet clear syntax. Dart incorporates JavaScript’s best practices into its language design. Dart has: classes, private variables, getter/setters, and convenient syntax for many common use cases. Dart handles the DOM and the rest of its library using modern design patterns (Futures and Streams). It is easy to write maintainable code in Dart. </p> <p>3) Dart’s semantics are designed for performance and versatility. Currently, Dart’s VM runs at about twice the speed of the best JavaScript VMs. Remember that on a mobile device, twice the CPU efficiency can mean twice the battery life. Dart’s VM is available in a special version of Chrome called Dartium and can also be used for command line and server-side coding.</p> <p>Dart has so many benefits it is hard to describe them in a short message. I have a longer version on my blog:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.appprogress.com/2014/02/why-dart-should-be-your-next-programming-language/\">Why Dart Should Be Your Next Programming Language</a></p> ","how_to_find_us":"In the mall #49","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1401202041000,"duration":9000000,"id":"185405712","name":"Learn about Android Wear","rsvp_limit":25,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1402615800000,"local_date":"2014-06-12","local_time":"17:30","updated":1402636328000,"utc_offset":-21600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":5,"is_online_event":false,"group":{"created":1297140090000,"name":"GDG Northern Colorado - Android/Chrome","id":1780067,"join_mode":"open","lat":40.529998779296875,"lon":-105.04000091552734,"urlname":"GDGNoCo","who":"Members","localized_location":"Fort Collins, CO","state":"CO","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Mountain"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDGNoCo/events/185405712/","manual_attendance_count":7,"description":"<p>Come for an overview of Android Wear, stay for a codelab!<br/>The Android platform has been extended to wearables.

The code for the gallery and the API are both public, so anyone who attends will be able to use these technologies to build their own app for Android and iOS.

This event will highlight the stories of our growing female community of designers, developers, and technology entrepreneurs.</p> <p>One of the most powerful thing women can do for other women in the field of technology is to simply share our stories.</p> <p>We would love to hear about your experience in technology! We would like to collect 2 to 5 min. stories from women who would like to share their experience with us. We would like to record and post the stories to youtube for other women around the world. The first 10 women volunteers to share their story will be awarded a very special gift bag (worth up to 15$). We will be providing refreshments and possibly other schwag for all participants, even those who do not want to share. Join us anyway!</p> <p>Please come and contribute your story or hear the stories of others and celebrate women in technology at this event. All women in technology are invited to join us at Aims on April 26 from 6 to 8 pm in the Ed Beaty theater.</p> <p>About Aims:<br/>Aims Associate Professor Jennifer Bailey is an organizer of the Google Developer Group and host of the event. After joining Aims in 2011 to teach Mobile Application development, she sought resources in the community to help her learn what the industry knows about technology.
