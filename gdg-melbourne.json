Nick did a fabulous job of founding this group and nurturing it through its initial stages, and has now handed over the group's administrative tasks to James and I. Let me stress again that we only see ourselves as administrators of the group, and would like Android Australia to become a truly independent, organic and community-driven user group. </p> <p>Android is at an amazing moment and we all know that it's going to explode in 2011 in Australia. With that, demand for Android developers will also grow by the day. As a community, we can only become stronger if we share our knowledge and resources, and help each other out with things we have discovered in true open source tradition. This means all members of the community who care about this group and its future should put their hands up to become more involved with it. </p> <p>James and I have had some preliminary discussions. We would like Android Australia to hold regular workshops and hackathons. We also think we could benefit from quarterly presentations and talks, and of course Q&amp;A sessions. We would like to interact more often with other mobile development groups and also with other open source projects at large. Perhaps we can sometimes take part in their gatherings with a talk about Android, and sometimes invite them to speak at our events. Ideally, we would also like to hold one big annual conference, in the style of Android Pro-Am that Nick organised so successfully last November (I still need to ask him what \"Pro-Am\" stands for!) We also hope that Android Australia could eventually become a home for start-ups, entrepreneurs, and everyone who thinks they've got a brilliant idea and would like to have a go. <br/>To shell out all these details, share our vision for the future of the group and explore other ideas, we are inviting all committed members to join us on Wednesday, February 23 at 6:00 PM at 243 Collins Street in Melbourne. jTribe is again graciously sponsoring the event and providing amenities. We couldn't do this without them. <br/>Also feel free to bring your laptops with the Android SDK/NDK installed. We would be hosting the first workshop in a very informal manner, where everyone can just demonstrate what they are working on, share some ideas and learn from each other. <br/>While everyone is welcome, we would like to keep this first workshop small, so that we can actually make decisions on the future of the group. Please make sure you come if you see yourself as someone who is going to stick around and be active and involved in the group. <br/>Pizza and beer will be provided, courtesy of our host jTribe. <br/>If you would like to join us, please go to <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Android-Australia-User-Group/\">&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Android-Australia-User-Group/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;<a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Android-Australia-User-Group/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.meetup.com/Android-Australia-User-Group/</a></a> to register your interest. We need to have an idea of how many people are coming to arrange for food and drinks.<br/>Feedback and comments are welcome, as always. <br/>Cheers<br/>-- <br/>Aryan</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1300238814000,"id":"16937274","name":"March Meetup","rsvp_limit":35,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1301468400000,"local_date":"2011-03-30","local_time":"18:00","updated":1301995077000,"utc_offset":39600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":32,"venue":{"id":1511755,"name":"OpenHub","lat":-37.81583786010742,"lon":144.96568298339844,"repinned":false,"address_1":"243 Collins Street","city":"Melbourne","country":"au","localized_country_name":"Australia"},"group":{"created":1297335372000,"name":"GDG Melbourne","id":1781437,"join_mode":"open","lat":-37.810001373291016,"lon":144.9600067138672,"urlname":"gdg-melbourne","who":"Developers","localized_location":"Melbourne, Australia","state":"","country":"au","region":"en_US","timezone":"Australia/Melbourne"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdg-melbourne/events/16937274/","why":"Monthly Meetup","description":"<p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>This month's main topic is <b>Near Field Communication</b>.</p> <p>Presenters:</p> <p>Organiser's Keynote Linden Darling to demo Android 3.0 on Motorola Xoom Talks on NFC Ben Bickford Hank The meeting room at OpenHub will be used to setup an NFC Reader/Writer and some NFC tags for people to explore.</p> <p>Food and beverages will be provided - thanks to our sponsor, jTribe.</p> <p>There is also a door prize for one lucky winner thanks to Crowdmass.</p> <p>Please note that his event finishes at 8:00PM and RSVP is mandatory!</p> <p> </p> <p>Also be sure to check out our discussion group at <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/android-australia\"><a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/android-australia\" class=\"linkified\">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/android-australia</a></a></p> <p>and website at <a href=\"http://androidaustralia.org/\"><a href=\"http://androidaustralia.org/\" class=\"linkified\">http://androidaustralia.org/</a></a></p> <p> </p> <p>Thanks!</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1301974607000,"id":"17187135","name":"Android Australia User Group: April Melbourne Meetup","rsvp_limit":50,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1303286400000,"local_date":"2011-04-20","local_time":"18:00","updated":1306315094000,"utc_offset":36000000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":48,"group":{"created":1297335372000,"name":"GDG Melbourne","id":1781437,"join_mode":"open","lat":-37.810001373291016,"lon":144.9600067138672,"urlname":"gdg-melbourne","who":"Developers","localized_location":"Melbourne, Australia","state":"","country":"au","region":"en_US","timezone":"Australia/Melbourne"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdg-melbourne/events/17187135/","description":"<p>Hi Everyone,</p> <p><b>Welcome to the our April MeetUp.

Connected</b> conference previewing their talks, both of which relate to Google technologies:</p> <p>- <b>“Was If Frag-ment To Be?” by Luke Sleeman</b>. The Fragment API forms one of the core components Google has provided to build Android apps. Despite the key role it is meant to play, many people find Fragments hard to use, prone to bugs and frustrating. We will pose the question - do we actually need Fragments? Are they worth the trouble?</p> <p>- <b>“Progressive Web Apps: What has the web ever done for us?” by Gareth Jones</b>. Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are an initiative being driven by Google that bring us a step closer to not needing to develop native mobile apps. This talk will give developers an insight into the problems that PWAs can solve, how you go about building them, and some ways to decide if they are right for your project.</p> <p>Note that these won’t be the full versions of the YOW! Connected presentations (you’ll have to go to the conference for those) but should give you a taste of what they’re all about. For more information about YOW!

To fit in all the content we are going to open doors at 5:30 so don't be late. For this month we have:</p> <p>• Main Talks:<br/>Hong Yew – \"Building your own Google assistant\"<br/>Mark Ng - \"Live Data 2\"</p> <p>• Lightning Talks:<br/>Troy Bebee – \"Developing on the Pixelbook - a quick guide to being productive\"<br/>Amanda Woo – \"The Dos and Don’ts of Data\"</p> <p>• Schedule</p> <p>Doors open just before 5:30pm, and talks will kickoff at 6:00pm.</p> <p>We are trying something different this month: we are not opening RSVPs until a week before the event. We are finding more than 60% of people who have RSVP'd are not turning up which means other people miss out! Hopefully with an RSVP closer to the date everyone will have a better idea of their plans!</p> <p>RSVPs Open: Wednesday, March 20,[masked]:00 PM</p> <p>If you RSVP Yes – Please arrive before 5:50pm, or your spot may be given to a waitlisted attendee.</p> <p>If you are on the waitlist – We cannot guarantee you a spot, but if you are interested in attending we will let in people on the waitlist after 5:50 in limited numbers. Please be at the venue before 5:50.</p> <p>Please note we have a hard cut off on the number of attendees due to venue capacity—get there early!</p> <p>Doors close at 6:00pm.</p> <p>Please see our waitlist policy for more details: <a href=\"https://www.gdgmelbourne.com/waitlist-policy/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.gdgmelbourne.com/waitlist-policy/</a></p> <p>There’ll also be pizza and when the talks finish up there’ll be more time for drinks and networking.
