Google has developed custom technologies to analyze this data and make intelligent product decisions.  We’ve started to open up some of these technologies as APIs which allow developers to concentrate on their business problems, while Google handles the underlying infrastructure.</p> <p>Google BigQuery is a Big Data analysis tool born from an internal technology known as Dremel. BigQuery enables developers to analyze terabyte data sets in seconds using a RESTful API and a SQL-like query language. We'll demonstrate how you can incorporate Google BigQuery into your own applications, and how queries are processed underneath the covers.  We’ll also show examples using public data sets and demos built by other developers like you.</p> <p>Speaker Bios:</p> <p><a href=\"http://profiles.google.com/ryan.boyd\"><b>Ryan Boyd</b></a> is a Developer Advocate at Google, focused on cloud data services such as Google BigQuery. He’s been in the Developer Relations group for 6 years and previously helped build out the Google Apps ISV ecosystem. Ryan recently published his first book on “Getting Started with OAuth 2.0” with O’Reilly.</p> <p><a href=\"http://profiles.google.com/michael.manoochehri\"><b>Michael Manoochehri</b></a>is a Google Engineer supporting developers who work with Google's Cloud and Data platforms. With many years of experience working for research and non-profit organizations, he is interested in making data analysis on large scale computing infrastructure more accessible and affordable.</p> <p>--------</p> <p><b>GCE &amp; GCS: Batch processing on demand</b></p> <p>We live in an age of inexpensive, powerful computing resources. Taking advantage of them no longer means sacrificing space or dedicating hours to maintenance. You can offload more and more of your batch computing workload to the cloud, and the newly announced Google Compute Engine offers scalable workload processing.</p> <p>This talk will describe how you can leverage Google’s computing infrastructure, which daily manages vast quantities of distributed data, at global scale, with sub-second response time, under extremely heavy load. Google Compute Engine is making this powerful infrastructure available to everyone. We’ll talk about how you can make the intersection between Google Cloud Storage and Google Compute Engine work for you and your business. We will show some live demonstrations that illustrate how using these powerful technologies can simplify and expedite your batch processing jobs.</p> <p>Speaker Bio:</p> <p><b>Julia Ferraioli</b> is a Developer Advocate working with Google Compute Engine.

We will learn about Apache Beam, an open source programming model unifying batch and stream processing and see how Apache Beam pipelines can be executed in Google Cloud Dataflow, a fully-managed cloud service for batch and stream data processing.</p> <p><b>Bret McGowen</b> (Serverless with Google Cloud) - From Functions-as-a-Service to Backend-as-a-Service, even Big Data-as-a-Service, Serverless is taking many different shapes. Learn what these mean and how Google Cloud Platform is building technology to make sure there's nothing standing between you and running your code. You'll see live demos of integration between Firebase, Cloud Functions, Cloud Pub/Sub (and even machine learning) to build autoscaling apps in record time - all without managing servers or application runtimes.</p> <p><b>Sara Robinson</b> (Analysing 33 million bike trips with BigQuery) - With so many people using NYC’s bike share program, I wanted to see if I could spot any trends in usage. But how did I go from observing bikers on the street to creating visualisations of popular routes based on different biker demographics? Enter Google’s managed big data analytics warehouse tool - BigQuery! Using BigQuery, I ran queries on 33 million bike trips and integrated my findings with a few visualisation tools. I’ll explain my process, do some live queries, and show you how to do the same analysis with your own data.</p> <p><b>Malcolm Holden</b> (Dataproc Overview) - Overview and demo of Google Cloud Platform's Dataproc: a managed Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, Apache Pig, and Apache Hive service, to easily process big datasets at low cost.</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1508892201000,"id":"244498747","name":"CROSS PROMOTION - Messaging Platforms & the Future of Work","rsvp_limit":2,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1510212600000,"local_date":"2017-11-09","local_time":"18:30","updated":1510225704000,"utc_offset":39600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":2,"venue":{"id":24428678,"name":"Domain Group Office","lat":-33.86856460571289,"lon":151.19444274902344,"repinned":false,"address_1":"55 Pyrmont Street","city":"Pyrmont, NSW","country":"au","localized_country_name":"Australia"},"group":{"created":1306990800000,"name":"GDG Sydney","id":1955151,"join_mode":"open","lat":-33.869998931884766,"lon":151.2100067138672,"urlname":"gdgsydney","who":"Members","localized_location":"Sydney, Australia","state":"","country":"au","region":"en_US","timezone":"Australia/Sydney"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/gdgsydney/events/244498747/","description":"<p>PLEASE RSVP ON THE EVENTBRITE PAGE: <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/messaging-platforms-and-the-future-of-work-tickets-39212310075\"><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/messaging-platforms-and-the-future-of-work-tickets-39212310075\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/messaging-platforms-and-the-future-of-work-tickets-39212310075</a></a></p> <p>The Slack Devrel Team is in the midst of their APAC tour and GDG Sydney is happy to help them with the Sydney leg.
