The Judge System is our online platform where you’ll form your team, join a hub, practice, and compete during the rounds. During the Online Qualification Round, you’ll watch Google's YouTube livestream to be introduced to the problem, and your team will have four hours to solve an optimization problem using the programming language and tools of your choice.

We will go through the basics such as how to setup a new project and install dependencies, create a web server using ExpressJS, send requests to a third party API, and use template files with Mustache!</p> <p>Rossano will talk about ReactJS, the new way to build user interfaces. For this first session he will cover simple and fundamental topics: basic concepts behind React and why it's so powerful, fragmentation of the UI into components, JSX and working with component's state and props.</p> <p>Come ready to develop with us. Make sure you have nodejs installed and working before coming to the DevTalk so we can easily start code. Pick one of your favourite editors too. Rossano likes Visual Studio Code, for example. If you have any problem, don't worry. We're going to help you setting up the development environment!</p> <p>There will be a short break between our two codelabs so you can enjoy some food and drinks, courtesy of our sponsor, the Galway Technology Centre!</p> <p>We hope you will find the time to join us for the start of an epic series of events!
