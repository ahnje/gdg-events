They are meant to be the new standard of the mobile web.Progressive Web Apps combine the engagement of native apps with the reach of the web. They are a concrete part of the Web’s platform.Building a high-quality Progressive Web App has benefits, including making it easy to delight your users, grow engagement and increase conversions.</p> <p>• 19:15 Break (15 min)</p> <p>• 19:30 <b>Server-less development with Firebase</b></p> <p>Firebase is a Backend-as-a-Service — BaaS — that started as a YC11 startup and grew up into a next-generation app-development platform on Google Cloud Platform. Firebase frees developers to focus crafting fantastic user experiences. You don’t need to manage servers. You don’t need to write APIs. Firebase is your server, your API and your datastore, all written so generically that you can modify it to suit most needs. Yeah, you’ll occasionally need to use other bits of the Google Cloud for your advanced applications. Firebase can’t be everything to everybody. But it gets pretty close.</p> <p>• 20:00 Break (15 min)</p> <p>• 20:15 <b>Live coding session</b></p> <p>We are creating a Progressive Web Application using Firebase. Everyone can bring his Laptop and code together with us. We will use a prepared shell project so we can have a working application in 30 min. Further instructions for the preparation will be provided later. </p> <p>Guide for Live-coding preparation: <a href=\"https://goo.gl/Wez2dE\"><a href=\"https://goo.gl/Wez2dE\" class=\"linkified\">https://goo.gl/Wez2dE</a></a> </p> <p>• 20:45 Discussions and networking</p> <p>We would like to thank <a href=\"http://wirtschaftsjunioren-bgl.de/\">Wirtschaftsjunioren Berchtesgadener Land</a> for bringing us together with Abel KG.</p> ","how_to_find_us":"Abel KG, Schrattenbachstraße 19, 83454 Anger","visibility":"public"},{"created":1510322607000,"duration":12600000,"id":"244995641","name":"Google Developer Group BGL December Meetup","rsvp_limit":15,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1512408600000,"local_date":"2017-12-04","local_time":"18:30","updated":1512509160000,"utc_offset":3600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":10,"venue":{"id":25604358,"name":"Talsen Team GmbH","lat":47.83744812011719,"lon":12.983238220214844,"repinned":false,"address_1":"Ludwig-Zeller-Str. 35","city":"Freilassing","country":"de","localized_country_name":"Germany"},"group":{"created":1505732520000,"name":"Google Developer Group BGL","id":25968520,"join_mode":"open","lat":47.84000015258789,"lon":12.989999771118164,"urlname":"GDG-BGL","who":"Mitglieder","localized_location":"Freilassing, Germany","state":"","country":"de","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Berlin"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-BGL/events/244995641/","manual_attendance_count":13,"description":"<p>Amazing time with the Google Developer Group BGL</p> <p>Our December meetup is hosted by Talsen Team GmbH (<a href=\"http://talsen.team/index.html\" class=\"linkified\">http://talsen.team/index.html</a>).

Docker provides an additional layer of abstraction and automation of operating-system-level virtualization on Windows and Linux.

UX or User Experience encompasses every aspect oft the end-user’s interaction with a product, service, or company. It’s obvious that you want to meet the exact needs of your customer and to reduce development costs by being more efficient. UX design as a discipline combines traditional Human Computer Interaction methods with lean practices. As a kickoff this talk will give you a brief overview of the concepts of Usability, User Experience and UI. Afterwards you will learn about a structured design process called User Experience Engineering Lifecycle. It’s all about enhancing user satisfaction with your product by improving the usability, accessibility, and pleasure provided in the interaction with it. At the end oft the talk you will understand that UI is only one part of a bigger dimension and you will be able to boost your performance in engineering your next minimum viable product. Make your customers fall in love with your products. Are you ready for the challenge?</p> <p>• 19:30 Playing with Google Daydream devices</p> <p>We as Google Developer Group received two Google Daydream VR devices as present. We will check them out.
