It is true that technology is becoming the ideal of the present age and it is proper to have everyone, irrespective of age and gender, gain their place in it. And so, they will be given a foundational lecture on areas such as; Web Development, Digital Marketing, Android Development, UI/UX Design, Technical Writing, Content Development, Project/Product Management and of course, Data Science.
