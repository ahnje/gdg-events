We show you how to expose an easily navigable visualization of the NYC subway using Google Maps JavaScript API.</p> <p>What you'll build</p> <p>In this codelab, you'll build a visualization for the NYC Subway Station dataset that is:</p> <p>Scalable - you'll use Google App Engine to automatically scale your serving capability to match request load. Maintainable - you'll use the Go programming language to make the back end code simple, reliable, and efficient. Customizable - you'll style the map using the styling capability of the Google Maps JavaScript API, with the help of Google Maps Style Wizard.</p> <p>There are no more available spaces for the Codelab - if you wish to participate, sign up for our waiting list in the registration form. We will contact you if a space becomes available for you. </p> <p>The Codelab will be run by Matt Toon, Sales Engineer at Google and the MapsPeople Development Team.</p> <p>Google I/O Extended 2017 will be held at the CREATE building at Aalborg University, which holds up to 250 people, so be sure to register today.</p> <p>PROGRAMME</p> <p>14:00: Codelab: Mapping the New York City Subway (FULLY BOOKED - WAITING LIST APPLIES)</p> <p>16:00: Registration - for everyone not participating in the Codelab</p> <p>16:30: Food and networking</p> <p>17:15: Group Photo</p> <p>17:30: Welcome - MapsPeople</p> <p>17:45: Google Developer Group Aalborg - A short introduction</p> <p>18:00: Opening - Pablo de la Horra, Google</p> <p>18:15: Sponsor pitches</p> <p>18:35: Short break - get a coke and some popcorn</p> <p>19:00: Keynote - Live streaming from Shoreline Amphitheatre Mountain View, California</p> <p>20:30 - 22:00: Afterparty.</p> <p>We reserve the right to make changes to the programme.</p> ","visibility":"public"},{"created":1497008810000,"duration":18000000,"id":"240662900","name":"Firebase Functions hands on code","rsvp_limit":30,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1498219200000,"local_date":"2017-06-23","local_time":"14:00","updated":1523888289000,"utc_offset":7200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":18,"venue":{"id":25105924,"name":"NOVI","lat":57.0125846862793,"lon":9.988571166992188,"repinned":false,"address_1":"Niels Jernes Vej 10 9220 Aalborg","city":"Aalborg","country":"dk","localized_country_name":"Denmark"},"group":{"created":1488306941000,"name":"Google Developer Group Aalborg","id":22687030,"join_mode":"open","lat":57.029998779296875,"lon":9.930000305175781,"urlname":"GDG-Aalborg","who":"Googler","localized_location":"Aalborg, Denmark","state":"","country":"dk","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Copenhagen"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Aalborg/events/240662900/","manual_attendance_count":28,"description":"<p>GDG Aalborg in partnership with BrainsBusiness invites you to attend our next event, this time, the main theme is Firebase, </p> <p><b>Google</b> is sending<b> Carlos Azaustre</b> and <b>Paola García</b> from Chefly Madrid, Spain to Aalborg to perform two sessions of Firebase codelab.
