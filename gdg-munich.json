In this talk we will discuss how to collect and how long to store user data to be respectful to the users and comply with applicable rules. We will present some best practices, tips, and tools that we use at Google on a daily basis.</p> <p>Talk 2: Building Privacy for the User<br/>by André Lago</p> <p>Building efficient privacy tools is essential in order to meet the user's expectations and provide them with control over their data. Because of this, it's extremely important to design privacy products in a way that fulfills the needs of the users and provides them positive value. In this talk we'll go through the history behind some of Google's main privacy products, describing some of the processes through which we design and develop them.</p> <p>Speakers:</p> <p>André Lago<br/>André is a Software Engineer working on some of Google's User-Facing Privacy products. By working on these products over the past year, André became passionate about how to design products that meet user's needs and constantly growing expectations.</p> <p>Stefan Toman<br/>Stefan is a Software Engineer at Google's Privacy and Data Protection Office in Munich. He works on tools and infrastructure for user consents that are used in most Google products. He deeply cares that users always have a fair choice on how their data is collected or used and that those choices are respected.
