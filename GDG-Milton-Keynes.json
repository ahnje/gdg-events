It is as easy as adding a video src=”video.mp4”, and you’re good to go. But, all the top video sites (YouTube, Netflix, Hulu) all stream their video.</p> <p>What do they know that we don’t know? Is streaming more efficient? Do I need any special equipment to create or serve video streams?</p> <p>In this talk, Doug explains how to create and stream videos, weigh the pros and cons of streaming vs. static videos, and see how easy it is to get started delivering streaming content on the web or to a mobile app.</p> <p>You’ll look at the performance aspects of delivering video on the web, and how to improve the performance of video by using streaming instead of static videos.</p> <p>Talk 2:<br/>Building an ARt Gallery in the Browser</p> <p>The world of virtual reality allows us to build new 3D interactive spaces that we can fill with anything we want - like the art of the great Renaissance masters. More into Cubism? With a quick click - now the gallery is full of a completely different genre.</p> <p>With new Augmented Reality (AR) features, we can actually build the gallery in our own space - and just as easily swap out the art - all in our browser!</p> <p>In this talk, we’ll walk through the steps to build a virtual ARt gallery, with web technology available today, but also take a peek at the new WebXR technology that is coming to our browsers soon!</p> <p>Agenda<br/>This is a 2 hour session<br/>6:00 pm: Registration and refreshments<br/>6:15 pm: Talk 1 - I Stream, You Stream: How Do I Make My Video Stream?<br/>7:00 pm: Break<br/>7:30 pm: Talk 2 - Building an ARt Gallery in the Browser<br/>8:30 pm: Workshop close</p> <p>Objectives<br/>At the end of the talks, you will be able to:<br/>Understand why you should consider video streaming for yourself or your company.<br/>See how easy it is to build a virtual ARt gallery.</p> <p>Audience<br/>Beginner &amp; Intermediate developers - it doesn't really matter if you are back end or front end or somewhere in the middle.<br/>You will come in with little or no prior video streaming or Augmented Reality knowledge, and come out with practical experience that you can apply to your first projects.<br/>Individuals​ ​thinking about creative new ​solutions​ ​or​ ​to​ ​integrate existing​ ​systems, application environments,​​​ ​and​ ​infrastructure​.</p> <p>Prerequisites<br/>As an attendee, we recommend that you meet these prerequisites:<br/>Assumes little prior knowledge of the subjects.<br/>It is expected that you will have an information technology or computing background, and have some hands-on familiarity with computing systems and databases.<br/>Bring your personal (not work) laptop and charger.<br/>We recommend having Chrome installed and you have a personal gmail account.</p> <p>If you can't make it, we have a live stream but you won't get to meet Doug personally and chat to him over pizza so be there to get the most out of it:</p> <p>Live stream:<br/>Talk 1<br/>I Stream, You Stream: How Do I Make My Video Stream?<br/><a href=\"https://youtu.be/i7g3wnVd6lQ\" class=\"embedded\">https://youtu.be/i7g3wnVd6lQ</a></p> <p>Talk 2<br/>Building an ARt Gallery in the Browser<br/><a href=\"https://youtu.be/iAKmK5gaRR0\" class=\"embedded\">https://youtu.be/iAKmK5gaRR0</a></p> <p>Our preference is for you to book on Eventbrite rather than here (but do not book on both)<br/><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/i-stream-you-stream-how-do-i-make-my-video-stream-using-arvr-on-web-tickets-83450575919\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/i-stream-you-stream-how-do-i-make-my-video-stream-using-arvr-on-web-tickets-83450575919</a></p> ","how_to_find_us":"Head into the car park, which is a one way system and park in any free parking bay.
