With Cloud Spanner you enjoy all the traditional benefits of a relational database: ACID transactions, relational schemas (and schema changes without downtime), SQL queries, high performance, and high availability. But unlike any other relational database service, Cloud Spanner scales horizontally, to hundreds or thousands of servers, so it can handle the highest of transactional workloads. With automatic scaling, synchronous data replication, and node redundancy, Cloud Spanner delivers up to[masked]% (five 9s) of availability for your mission critical applications. In fact, Google’s internal Spanner service has been handling millions of queries per second from many Google services for years.</p> ","how_to_find_us":"Fulton Market at the Google Chicago Office","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1484326245000,"duration":7200000,"id":"nnxmpmywhbpb","name":"GCPUG - Using BigQuery and Looker for Business Intelligence","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1495146600000,"local_date":"2017-05-18","local_time":"17:30","updated":1495156637000,"utc_offset":-18000000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":77,"venue":{"id":12808262,"name":"TechNexus","lat":41.88240051269531,"lon":-87.6378173828125,"repinned":false,"address_1":"20 N Upper Wacker Dr ","address_2":"Suite 1200","city":"Chicago","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"60606","state":"IL"},"group":{"created":1482423895000,"name":"Google Developers Group: GDG Cloud Chicago","id":21659496,"join_mode":"open","lat":41.939998626708984,"lon":-87.75,"urlname":"Google-Developers-Group-GDG-Cloud-Chicago","who":"Members","localized_location":"Chicago, IL","state":"IL","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Central"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/Google-Developers-Group-GDG-Cloud-Chicago/events/nnxmpmywhbpb/","description":"<p>BigQuery is a petabyte-scale analytics data warehouse that you can use to run SQL queries over vast amounts of data in near real time.</p> <p>Looker helps you make sense of your BigQuery data and help you analyze the data interactively.
